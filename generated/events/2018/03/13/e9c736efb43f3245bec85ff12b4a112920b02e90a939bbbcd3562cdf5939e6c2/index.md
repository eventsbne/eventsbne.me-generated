<p>**VENUE CHANGE** for the March meetup. Our usual home is unavailable. The meetup will be hosted at Red Hat. Attendance is capped due to capacity constraint.</p> <p>=== Functional programming tasting plate - Dave Laing ===</p> <p>There are plenty of talks that introduce the basics of functional programming, and there are quite a few talks that try to explain some complex conceptual or theoretical piece of the puzzle. This is not either of those talks. Instead, we'll be taking a series of shallow dives into a handful of libraries and tools in the functional programming space that are particular good at getting people excited.</p> <p>The main theme will be showing off the nice things you can unearth if you have a community of motivated and curious folks from a lot of different domains and have them dig in a lot of different directions. To that end we'll be looking at some interesting tools for abstraction, parsing, concurrency, rest APIS, testing and benchmarking.</p> <p>=== An Accessible Introduction to Dependent Types - Donovan Crichton ===</p> <p>This talk will introduce the concepts of dependently-typed programming from a use-case driven point of view. We'll introduce the fundamentals of dependent types and give you the basic tools needed to produce dependently typed programs in the functional language (that supports dependent types!) of your choice.</p> <p>Specifically we'll have examples from Haskell and Idris, showing where and how Haskell has support for dependently typed programs, and where Idris (which fully supports dependent types) can pick up the slack! This is a practical talk with no references to category theory or type theory, the concepts will come from everyday (and some not-so everyday) practical examples!</p> <p>We'll cover: GADTS and Closed Type Families in Haskell, and their equivalent in Idris (Dependent data-types and Type-level functions), and some examples from the problem that introduced the speaker to dependent types from the areas of Artificial Intelligence and Domain Specified Languages.</p> <p>This is an intermediate-level talk and knowledge of the following would be very useful: Haskell/Idris Syntax (they're basically the same!), Parameterised Data Types, and Functions.</p>
