<p>**VENUE CHANGE** for the March meetup. Our usual home is unavailable. The meetup will be hosted at Red Hat. Attendance is capped due to capacity constraint.</p> <p>Functional programming tasting plate - Dave Laing</p> <p>There are plenty of talks that introduce the basics of functional programming, and there are quite a few talks that try to explain some complex conceptual or theoretical piece of the puzzle.<br/>This is not either of those talks. Instead, we'll be taking a series of shallow dives into a handful of libraries and tools in the functional programming space that are particular good at getting people excited.</p> <p>The main theme will be showing off the nice things you can unearth if you have a community of motivated and curious folks from a lot of different domains and have them dig in a lot of different directions.<br/>To that end we'll be looking at some interesting tools for abstraction, parsing, concurrency, rest APIS, testing and benchmarking.</p>
