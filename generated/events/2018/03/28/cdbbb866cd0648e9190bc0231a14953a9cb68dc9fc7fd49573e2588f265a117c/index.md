<p>Ground Truth is a fascinating, ambitious project looking at the changes in Queensland's landscape over the past 30 years—through the lens of the US Geological Survey's satellites.</p> <p>Schedule<br/>6:00pm Arrive / Socialise / Grab a drink<br/>6:30pm Dan Petrie<br/>7:00pm Drinks / Food / Open Discussion<br/>8:00pm Close / Socialise</p> <p>Every 16 days the USGS satellite takes a new snapshot of Queensland—but it's not 'pictures' it's taking (at least, not in the traditional sense), but a data snapshot. There's a lot going on behind the scenes to turn that data-dump into the familiar look of a satellite image.</p> <p>The exhibition, put together by new media artist Grania Kelly and a cross disciplinary crew from QUT's Institute for Future Environments.</p> <p>Come and meet some of the folks behind this exciting project.</p> <p>See more: <a href="https://groundtruthnetwork.com/" class="linkified">https://groundtruthnetwork.com/</a></p>
