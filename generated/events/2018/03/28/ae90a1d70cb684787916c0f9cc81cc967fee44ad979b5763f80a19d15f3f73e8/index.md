<p>Games are a great way to learn agile and lean principles. Within ThoughtWorks, we often play agile games to practice our craft, and keep our tools sharp. Come join us, and learn through play with the Kanban Pizza Game (originally designed by agile42).</p> <p>Whilst making paper pizza (and eating real pizza!), we get the tech out of the way, and introduce the theories behind agile software development through simulation.</p> <p>Our special guest and speaker this evening will be Cathie Hagen, a Lead Consultant at ThoughtWorks, who will cover the fundamentals of agile delivery through a series of presentations, while we play the Kanban Pizza Game. Cathie wears many hats, including business analysis, iteration management, agile and lean coaching, cat herding, working with people to ensure that the right thing is delivered the right way.</p> <p>-------------------------</p> <p>Housekeeping:<br/>* Dinner and drinks supplied by ThoughtWorks :)<br/>* If you arrive after 6pm, please look out for the signs, and give us a call and someone will let you in - (07)[masked]</p>
