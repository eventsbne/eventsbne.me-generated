<p>• What we'll do<br/>Hey everyone, this month we are doing a Brisbane Indie Games Showcase instead of our usual presentation for Brisbane Unity Meetup.</p> <p>WHERE? River City Labs - Level 2</p> <p>WHEN? Monday 26th March from 5:30 pm to 8 pm. The idea is that from 5:30 to about 6:15 it will be setting up / a Dev-to-Dev networking event, more on the casual side. From 6:15-ish it will be a mini showcase to hopefully the wider public and potentially local Twitch streamers.</p> <p>WHY? This is a perfect opportunity for you to meet other devs in a quiet relaxed environment, to get some play testing and feedback, to conduct market research (such as trailers, elevator pitches etc.), or to simply gain that experience interacting with potential players prior to the bigger expo events (ie PAX). Just remember to get those emails. ;)</p> <p>WHO? For the showcase we would like games that are at a reasonable state of quality and representative of the final game. However, if you simply want to bring your portfolio earlier to show other people, or to show a trailer, whatever then it's all cool. We are focusing on being inclusive - if you think you can get something out of it then please attend. If you don't have anything right now please rock up and show your support anyway!</p> <p>HOW? Email me at [masked] , message me on meetup or leave a message on this event. Spots are open but limited.</p> <p>WHAT an awesome thing.</p> <p>Please note: Apologies for it being such short notice. This is an experiment so feedback is welcome and slight changes may occur. Please bring all your own gear. Also nothing that would be deemed inappropriate in a public space.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Your own gear if showcasing, business cards, portfolio, surveys - anything that will help you get something out of this.</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>Public disclaimer: We hold no responsibility for lost or damaged equipment.</p>
