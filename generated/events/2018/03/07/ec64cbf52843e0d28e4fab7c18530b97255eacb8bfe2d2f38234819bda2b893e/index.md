<p>Bitcoin for Beginners</p> <p>Gold Coast| Bitcoin for WOMEN | 7:00pm - 8:30pm<br/>With the Self Love Sisters, Lisa Pace-Renata &amp; Kelly Slattery</p> <p>On Wednesday Evening You Will:</p> <p>Learn how Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are changing the face of the finance and how you get in the game, including:</p> <p>• How to buy Bitcoin and what to look out for in an exchange provider.</p> <p>• 7 different ways to grow your Bitcoin and the level of expertise required for each.</p> <p>• The top 3 ways to spend your Bitcoin and your options for maintaining anonymity, and much more….</p> <p>￼</p> <p><img src="https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/b/f/2/600_466196306.jpeg" /></p> <p>We are in a unique space where Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are in their infancy and have not yet hit the mainstream, this makes the timing optimal to learn about the potential of Bitcoin and the advantages it is bringing to the world.</p> <p>Right now there is a window of opportunity to invest that has been likened to the beginning of Microsoft, Apple, Google and Youtube - it is affordable and accessible.</p> <p>Imagine if you could go back in time and buy up shares in these companies!</p> <p>As the adoption of cryptocurrencies increases, we will see the influence of institutions, organisations and regulators that will push prices higher, if you're in the game before this happens you will be poised to reap the rewards.</p> <p>We see this time as an opportunity for a transfer of wealth that is available to everyday people like you, who are willing to learn because right now there are very few barriers to entry.</p> <p>Lisa &amp; I are passionate about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies because we see it as a vehicle for you to generate enough money to be able to work on projects that you are passionate about and make a positive difference in the world.</p> <p>There is a real problem in the world today, in that most people have never been taught how to manage money, let alone how to create wealth. So it is not surprising that there is a level of fear and uncertainty when it comes to something so new and “out there” as digital money.</p> <p>The good news is, that Bitcoin has proven itself over the past 7 years to be a powerful force that is changing the face of finance AND many financial experts are also uncomfortable with the change - so that levels the playing field for learning in this space.</p> <p>At Self Love Sisters we believe in big visions linked to baby steps and we understand that Life rewards action and we are here to support you in your Bitcoin journey.</p> <p>We look forward to helping you discover a new way to create the financial freedom you deserve.</p> <p>Come along and grab some breakfast and a drink while you learn how to make 2018 your most profitable year!!</p> <p>Who is this Meetup for?</p> <p>- Women who understand that change is inevitable and want to be ahead of the curve.</p> <p>- Women who are willing to feel the fear and do it anyway.</p> <p>- Women who want to have a better lifestyle.</p> <p>- Women who want to spend their time working on projects that they are passionate about.</p> <p>- Women who are willing to take baby steps to move toward, even if it is uncomfortable.</p> <p>- Women who love to learn and grow</p> <p>Who is this Meetup NOT for?</p> <p>- People who already have experience with Bitcoin</p> <p>- People who never take action</p> <p>- People who DON'T want to learn about Bitcoin</p> <p>- People who can’t follow instructions</p> <p>- People who don’t ever want to change</p> <p>- People who are searching for some type of trick, tip, secret or magic bullet that will make them rich</p> <p>Get to know Lisa &amp; Kelly on Facebook (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/selflovesistersloveandmoney/" class="linkified">https://www.facebook.com/selflovesistersloveandmoney/</a>)</p> <p><img src="https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/3/7/a/600_466198234.jpeg" /></p>
