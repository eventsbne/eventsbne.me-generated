title: How to retain great people  - Peter Day
date: '2018-03-02T10:00:13.637Z'

<p>So you’ve identified a business opportunity, hired great people and have started developing a solution. What next? How do you retain these people and keep them working with you?</p> <p>Peter Day used to be a lawyer, solving his clients’ problems through a combination of analysis, communication and coffee. However, after discovering he had a personality, he quit the legal profession and started working in IT. Now, with nearly a decade of experience in delivering software, he applies those same skills to lead software teams in agile environments.</p>
