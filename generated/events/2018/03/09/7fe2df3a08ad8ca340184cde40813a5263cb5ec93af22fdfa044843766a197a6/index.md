    \r\nChangeMakeHer is a youth-led organisation of girls in grades 7-12 united
    by a common passion to empower young girls to become the ChangeMakeHers of
    the future through fostering a community and hosting events. Focusing on
    fields where women are currently underrepresented, such as entrepreneurship,
    STEAM, and leadership, our organisation targets young girls in particular,
    focusing on the way they think about their place in the world.
