<p>Come and join us for Fishburners weekly Friday drinks and community pitch night and celebrate International Womens Day!</p> <p>Each week we get our community together to wind down the week, share wins and losses and have three of our startups introduce themselves to the community via a 3-5 minute pitch. This week we'll be celebrating our female founders for International Womens Day! These pitches are an informal way for our members to practice pitching and wind down the end of the week together. We've opened these events up to the public so if you want to stop by and see what goes on please join us. See you there!</p> <p>*Please note: by RSVPing to this event you agree to join Fishburners email newsletter.</p> <p>â€¢ Important to know<br/>Entry is via the Brisbane Information Centre/Regent Theatre.</p>
