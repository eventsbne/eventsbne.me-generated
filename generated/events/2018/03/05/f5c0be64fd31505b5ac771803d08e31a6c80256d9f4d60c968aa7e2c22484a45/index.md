<p>PLEASE NOTE It's a Monday and not our usual Tuesday</p> <p>We've got a super interesting topic to kick off 2018! We're going to be looking at UX and design considerations for Virtual and Augmented Reality. Not something a lot of us get to play with right now, but I think it's a safe best to say it's a growing field that will have more and more of an effect on our professions.</p> <p>Our presenter for the night is Lex Van Cooten. He began as a virtual reality developer in early 2014, working with the second iteration of the Oculus Rift Developer Kit, before its commercial release. Lex also launched the Brisbane Virtual Reality Club (<a href="http://virtualrealitybrisbane.com/" class="linkified">http://virtualrealitybrisbane.com/</a>) in 2014, which has become the largest monthly event open to the general public in Queensland, offering education and networking opportunities to enthusiasts and developers interested in Virtual and Augmented Reality technology. Lex also launched Immerse (<a href="http://immerseenterprise.com/" class="linkified">http://immerseenterprise.com/</a>), which provides development and educational services through Immerse Enterprise and Immerse Academy.</p> <p>The Talk: Tonight Lex will be presenting on VR (Virtual Reality) and AR (Augmented Reality) best practices when it comes to UX design and implementation. His experience working with clients across multiple industries, with different use cases for VR/AR technology has given him insights into what works and doesnâ€™t work when it comes to creating impactful and useful immersive experiences.</p> <p>Hope to see you then!</p>
