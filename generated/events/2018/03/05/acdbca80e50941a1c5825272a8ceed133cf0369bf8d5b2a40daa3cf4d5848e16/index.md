<p>Four great speakers, pizza and beer, the opportunity to network with your peers. Join us for this action-packed episode of BrisJS.</p> <p>6:30 PM - Welcome &amp; introductions feat. Kevin Vanderbeken</p> <p>üë©‚Äçüíª NodeGirls &amp; the traits of a good mentor - Anwesha Chatterjee - 6:45 PM<br/>Anwesha is promoting the upcoming NodeGirls workshop (<a href="http://bit.ly/nodegirlsmarch18" class="linkified">http://bit.ly/nodegirlsmarch18</a>) looking for mentors and attendees. As part of this we'll learn what makes a good mentor, and how you can support and teach those around you.</p> <p>üê¶ Flappy Bird under 5 minutes - Lochlan Bunn - 7:00 PM<br/>Flappy Bird will save you from boredom for about 5 minutes at a time. Instead of playing it, Lochlan will attempt to build it from scratch! Will he succeed?</p> <p>üì∞ Experiences working as a fellow at the ABC - Zoe Meers - 7:15 PM<br/>The Google News Lab Fellowship offers those interested in journalism &amp; technology the opportunity to spend the summer working at relevant organizations across the world. We'll hear how Zoe got involved, and what it's like working on data journalism at the ABC.</p> <p>üçª Intermission, pizza &amp; networking - 7:30 PM<br/>Pizza sponsored by PCCW Global, Beer by Just Digital People, and good company by the friendly BrisJS crowd. Pizzas include vegetarian and gluten free options and drinks include beer, soda or water. If you have specific dietary requirements, please get in touch before the event.</p> <p>üöß Building Static Sites with React - Tim Holt - 8:00 PM<br/>React is great for client side applications, but has a heavy upfront performance cost. So what if your site doesn't need to run a single page app? Tim will show us how to scaffold a website using Create React App, hook it up to content from a CMS and deploy as a static website on AWS S3.</p> <p>üëâ Code of Conduct</p> <p>BrisJS is dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone. Our anti-harassment policy can be found at: <a href="https://bris.js.org/#conduct" class="linkified">https://bris.js.org/#conduct</a></p> <p>üëâ Accessibility</p> <p>The upper and lower car parks in Toowong Tower are open until 10:30 at night, leaving plenty of time for you to leave after the event. BrisJS is wheelchair accessible from the taxi rank, car parks and train station, but please note the train station is only wheelchair accessible via the street after the centre closes at 9pm.</p>
