<p>• What we'll do<br/>This month, Brisbane Women in Blockchain Meetup will be talking with Riley Kinnunen, Co-Founder of EE3 and a key organiser of the Flux Party. EE3 is a blockchain company building a market place for the trading of carbon credits. The Flux Party is a political movement using blockchain technology to modernise our democratic systems. <a href="https://voteflux.org/" class="linkified">https://voteflux.org/</a></p> <p>Riley is a mathematician and a technologist, an early adopter of Bitcoin and is deeply immersed in blockchain technology. When not working hard behind the scenes at Flux, Riley is involved in a number of global blockchain projects including a decentralised vetting system, the Metacurrency project and building blockchain enabled carbon marketplace for the trading of carbon-based commodities - EE3. Riley is also preparing for an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). Please come along, sit back and enjoy hearing Riley's story.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Complimentary lunch will be provided. Please DM me if you have any dietary requirements.</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>Brisbane Women in Blockchain Meetup has a code of conduct. I generally put aside 30 minutes from 12.00 pm to 12.30 pm for a networking lunch then from 12.30 pm to 1.30 pm for the Meetup and then 1.30 pm to 2.00 pm for more networking.</p>
