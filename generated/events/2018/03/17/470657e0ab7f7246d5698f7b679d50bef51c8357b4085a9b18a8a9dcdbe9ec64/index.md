<P><SPAN><STRONG>Science Hack Day</STRONG> is a weekend event where anyone excited about making things with science comes together in the same physical space to see what they can prototype within 24 consecutive hours. Scientists, engineers, designers, developers, artists, and anyone who is excited about making things with science are welcome to attend â€“ <EM>no experience in science or hacking is necessary</EM>. People organically form multidisciplinary teams over the course of the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>The official event website has everything you need to know about the event and will be updated regularly as we get closer to the event. Check it out at http://brisbane.sciencehackday.org/<BR></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>This mini-documentary by KQED television in San Francisco shows what the event there is like and how it works.</SPAN></P>

<P><STRONG>FAQs</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?</STRONG></P>
<P>This event is primarily intended for those over the age of 18. Those under 18 may attend if accompanied by an adult and can't stay overnight on the Saturday night.<BR></P>
<P><STRONG>What are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event?</STRONG></P>
<P>There is parking at HSBNE and plenty of street parking. You can also get there by public transport. See the <A HREF="http://hsbne.org/thespace.html" TARGET="_blank" REL="noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow">HSBNE site</A> for more details.<BR></P>
<P><STRONG>Do I need to have a project in mind or a team organised when I sign up?</STRONG></P>
<P>Absolutely not! Most people don't have a plan coming in although might have a feeling about the kind of work they'd like to do. (Maybe they want to do something code-based, or maybe something electronics based, or maybe something textile based. But there's no reason why you couldn't plan something conceptual, or performance based, or anything else!)</P>
<P>You also don't need to have collaborators lined up. Most people come as individuals, and we encourage people to spend some of the initial parts of the event just talking to people, looking at what they're doing, and asking questions. We ask people who have a team in place to be open to adding anybody who is interested.</P>
<P><STRONG>What do I actually DO at the event?</STRONG></P>
<P>Basically, you'll form a team and help make things with science. That can mean any kind of science, or science-connected idea. There are lots of possible roles you can take. You might have an idea and lead a team. You might be really into physically building stuff. Perhaps you are more interested in helping design a project, whether the building or the presentation of it. You might just want to chat through the process and contribute ideas. You might even just want to listen and learn as you go. You take the role that you feel comfortable with and we'll help you find the spot that works for you.</P>
<P><STRONG>What can I bring into the event?</STRONG></P>
<P>We encourage you to bring materials that you might find useful in your projects. There are lots of great facilities and tools at HSBNE but be aware that you might need to find somebody who has been approved to use them to help if you want to take advantage of things like the woodworking facilities. Some people bring things like electronics gear (Arduinos, sensors, motors, etc. -- soldering irons and electronics tools are available but it never hurts to bring your own toolkit). Some people have brought robots, LIDAR sensors, and other more exotic equipment. Some people make things from fabric, cardboard, or LEGO. It's really up to you!<BR></P>
<P><STRONG>Does the event run all night?</STRONG></P>
<P>Most of the night, if you want! The hackerspace is open 24 hours but we need to have some hackerspace members there if we as visitors are going to be in the space. So I suspect that the place will be open into the wee hours of the morning but think about getting a little sleep so you're refreshed to begin hacking again on Sunday! There is no need to stay late, however, and there is still plenty of time for you to work on projects. Some people are just hardcore about their hacking and want to keep going as long as possible! Only over-18s can stay through the night though.</P>
<P><STRONG>Do I present what I've done?</STRONG></P>
<P>Yes! And this is one of the most fun parts of the event. Everybody who wants to can present for 2 minutes--yes, it's a lightning presentation--whatever they've done during the event. You don't need to have finished. Lots of people like to hear about work in progress or failed attempts. This can also be a good way to find people who might want to help develop the project beyond the event itself.</P>
<P><STRONG>How can I contact the organizer with any questions?</STRONG></P>
<P>If you click on the name of David Harris, the organizer up there in the top right hand corner or the contact link down below on his profile, you can send a question!<BR></P>
