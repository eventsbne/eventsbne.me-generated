<p>Our guest for the evening will be Mark Trenchard who co-founded Hydrox Technologies with his brother in 2015. With a background in plastic film manufacturing and a focus on Agriculture, Hydrox has Launched Solar Shrink, a patented product for growing crops such as strawberries, tomatoes, capsicum, melons and chilies.</p> <p>A $20,000 dollar investment using personal credit cards in 2014 was the seed capital that has allowed the company to grow, capturing more than 50% of the Australian market. With production capacity reached, Hydrox Technologies is now raising capital to expand globally. Their product branded “Solar Shrink” uses up to 35% less plastic, is up to 300% stronger, is smarter and up to 15% cheaper for farmers.</p> <p>Mark has recently returned from the USA where Hydrox Technologies won a Top 10 New Products Award sponsored by Bank Of America at the World Ag Expo, the world’s largest agricultural show. He joins us to share his story of resilience; how they recovered from two major business killers beyond their control to become the major player in the Australian agricultural plastics market.</p> <p>I look forward to catching up with everyone at the Event.</p> <p>Cheers</p> <p>Zak</p>
