<p>[If you missed a spot, please join the wait-list, as sometimes registrants drop out.</p> <p>I have looked behind the couch for parts, and 20 kits is the absolute maximum for this event.</p> <p>One registration is for one kit. You may bring guests (spouse, friend, children as you please) for no extra cost, there is no need to register non-kit guests.]</p> <p>• What we'll do</p> <p>The era of the Internet of Things lets us solve those particular problems that cause us stress or aggravation, but for which no mass market solution exists. In this workshop, you will learn how to build and program your own Internet Things.</p> <p>What can you do at this workshop? Whatever you can imagine.</p> <p>Some examples; Make a smart doorbell that messages your phone, and turns on the porch light. It can even tell you if you left the front door open when you have that moment of panic halfway to work.</p> <p>Winter is coming! Make a temperature sensor for your child's bedroom to be sure they are not too cold (respiratory infeactions associated with poor insulation can be an insidious problem in older houses). Monitor your pool or solar-hot-water temperature. Text your pool filter to turn it on or off.</p> <p>Display the weather forecast on a small screen at the front door.</p> <p>You will receive a starter kit consisting of computer, data and power cable, enclosure and sensor of your choice (suitable for the above projects and more). Extra components are available to purchase if you have a particular problem you want to solve. • What to bring</p> <p>Bring a laptop computer (Windows, Mac or Linux), and your creativity.</p> <p>• Important to know</p> <p>There will be a cost of $20 per kit for this event that covers refreshments, afternoon tea and your starter kit. You can pay on the day by cash or card.</p> <p>Attendance will be limited to 20 kits (you can share a kit with a friend or family at no extra cost). Children are welcome, and there is a media room should younger children lose focus.</p> <p>You can choose, or 3D print, a box for your project too.</p>
