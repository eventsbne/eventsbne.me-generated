<P CLASS="MsoNormal">The SFPE - UQ Student Chapter invites you to our 2nd Seminar of 2018:</P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal">"Fire Engineering in Practice"</P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal">by James O'Neill (Holmes Fire)</P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><BR></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal">Abstract:</P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal">What does it mean to be a fire engineer in the modern construction environment? This presentation will cover some general issues we face every day, new trends such as the rise of tall timber buildings, and case studies to cover lessons learnt in practice.</P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal">Bio:</P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal">James O’Neill has been consulting in Sydney for the last five years as a Fire Engineer for Holmes Fire, and has recently moved to Brisbane as the Branch Manager to grow the company into the Queensland market. James has a Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering, a Masters of Fire Engineering and a Ph.D. in Fire Engineering from the University of Canterbury in New Zealand where he has specialised in the structural fire analysis of heavy timber assemblies for multi-storey buildings. James has carried out full scale fire testing and finite element analysis of timber floor assemblies, has co-authored numerous design guidelines on the fire design of heavy timber assemblies such as LVL, glulam and CLT systems, and also sits on the committee revising fire design for timber standards in Australia and New Zealand.</P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><BR></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal">LIGHT REFRESHMENTS WILL BE PROVIDED. THIS EVENT IS FREE OF CHARGE.</P>
