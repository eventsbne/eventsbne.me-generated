title: Using Bayesian Profile Regression to find groupings (clusters) within data
date: '2018-03-05T10:00:13.567Z'

---
<p>The Presentation:</p> <p>Are you trying to identify groupings within your data? Bayesian Profile Regression allows doing just that! Unlike conventional regression analysis, it also allows estimating the simultaneous effect of many highly correlated variables, while handling missing data.</p> <p>The use of Bayesian Profile Regression will be demonstrated using a study from the area of cyber criminology. The recently developed R package PReMiuM will be used to fit the Bayesian Profile Regression.</p> <p>Our Presenter: Zarina Vakhitova is a PhD student (Griffith University) specialising in criminology and criminal justice. She is also a full-time researcher working for Queensland Police Service. Her research interests include quantitative methods of social research, Bayesian statistical analysis, environmental criminology, situational crime prevention and cybercrime.</p> <p>Our Sponsor this month:</p> <p>AARNet Pty Ltd (APL) is the not for profit company that operates Australia's Academic and Research Network (AARNet). The shareholders are 38 Australian universities and the CSIRO.</p> <p>AARNet provides high capacity Internet and other communications services for the nation's research and education community, including universities, health and other research organisations, schools, vocational training providers and cultural institutions. AARNet serves over one million end users who access the network for teaching, learning and research.</p> <p>For further information, please visit: www.aarnet.edu.au (<a href="http://www.aarnet.edu.au/" class="linkified">http://www.aarnet.edu.au/</a>)</p> <p>Location and Time:</p> <p>Our event space is sponsored by Fishburners.
