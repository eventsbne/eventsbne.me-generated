<p>Topic: What is WP-CLI and how you can use it to Manage WordPress?<br/>Presented by: Robert Wilde<br/>Location: River City Labs, Fortitude Valley</p> <p>WP-CLI or the WordPress-Command Line Interface is an exceptionally powerful tool to help you manage your WordPress site. It is very easy to use and during this presentation Mr Wilde will show you how you can use it to check and update your plugins, themes, WordPress core, add and edit users, backup the database and more.<br/>We will discuss the command line, how to install WP-CLI and touch on some ways to extend it in your plugins or create simple scripts to spin up WordPress installs pre-configured with plugins, themes and settings in seconds. If you manage your own WordPress site or several for clients, this is a presentation not to miss.</p> <p>As always we will start the night with Mr Wilde's DT's for March 2018.
