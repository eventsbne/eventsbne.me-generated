<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>Our Professional Learning Experiences are designed to give teachers hands-on experiences with drone technology for environmental science applications.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>This is a 2.5 hour session held at the Victoria Point SHS School Hall; in partnership with Victoria Point State High School.<STRONG><BR></STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>Teachers will work in teams of three throughout the session and swap between the roles of Pilot in Charge, Co-Pilot, and Chief Reporter. Each role is given responsibilities similar to those undertaken ‘in real life’. All teachers will be actively involved at all times and given ample opportunity to discuss how the activities can be incorporated into classroom learning.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>Learning objectives of the program include:</DIV>
<DIV>-  To understand a range of drone based applications (facilitated discussion);</DIV>
<DIV>-  To explore the role of gender in society, particularly with respect to stereotypes and STEM careers (facilitated discussion);</DIV>
<DIV>-  To understand Australian remote pilot regulations and safety considerations (facilitated discussion);</DIV>
<DIV>-  To gain confidence and competence in manual flight (hands on);</DIV>
<DIV>-  To successfully code a drone for autonomous flight to solve a real-world survey challenge (hands on); and</DIV>
<DIV>-  To discuss options for bringing drone technology into your classroom (facilitated discussion).</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>A key part of our She Flies programs is the link to the Australian Curriculum across a wide variety of general capabilities and learning areas, including digital technologies. Providing activities linked to the real and emerging world of technology adds depth and richness to learning. Our professional learning experience is linked to the following curriculum areas:</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>Literacy</DIV>
<DIV>Students develop literacy capability by listening to, reading, viewing, speaking and writing oral, print, visual and digital texts, and using and modifying language for different purposes through drone-related activities.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>Numeracy</DIV>
<DIV>Students are required to think critically and creatively to solve real world problems using drone technology.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>Critical and Creative Thinking</DIV>
<DIV>Activities provide students opportunities to interpret and transfer mathematical knowledge and skill to an environmental application of drone technology.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>ICT Capability</DIV>
<DIV>Students develop capability in using ICT and emerging drone technologies through creating digital solutions to problems using computational thinking, controlling processes and devices, analysing data and communicating collaboratively with others. Students learn to use ICT and drone technology with confidence and care considering its possibilities, limitations, and its potential impacts.</DIV>
<DIV><BR></DIV>
<DIV>Personal and Social Capability</DIV>
<DIV>Students develop skills to promote a positive sense of self and to build and maintain respectful relationships through teamwork and negotiate and resolve conflicts. Each student is given the opportunity to communicate effectively and develop their own leadership skills.</DIV>
