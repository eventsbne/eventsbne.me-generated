<p>I will be looking at changing your .htaccess file to ensure that your secure site is used no matter what the user types into the browser.</p> <p>Stuart will be looking at permissions on S3 buckets and then looking at Plotalot.</p> <p>Plotalot makes it easy to create live charts and place them on your site. You must be able to write the SQL queries to retrieve the data you want to plot, but if you can do that, Plotalot will take the data and use the Google Charts API to produce many different kinds of charts with numerous formatting options.</p> <p>You can display charts on your site using the free Plotalot component, although this page uses the Plotalot Plugin to embed charts in a Joomla article which gives more flexibility.</p> <p>Parking is available underneath after 5pm. Meetings begin at 6pm so please consider this when coming down. The city flyer Bus stops right near here, so public transport is easy to access.</p>
