<p>Due to some changes withing the Library and the small numbers of attendees at meetings lately, we have decided to change venues. Also, if you no longer take part in Joomla or wish to leave the meetup group, then please do so we can get accurate numbers of who to contact.</p> <p>The form of this and future meetings at this stage will be bring your problems and let us look at them and general informal discussions on components used etc.</p> <p>Stuart has offered us this great casual space to use, so please take advantage of it and further your Joomla knowledge.</p> <p>Parking is available underneath after 5pm. Meetings begin at 6pm so please consider this when coming down. The city flyer Bus stops right near here, so public transport is easy to access.</p>
