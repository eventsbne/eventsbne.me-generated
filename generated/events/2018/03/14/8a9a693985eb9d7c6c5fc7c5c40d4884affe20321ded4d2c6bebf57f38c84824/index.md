<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><STRONG>OVERVIEW</STRONG></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><EM>Transparency in the Agri-Food Value Chain</EM></P>
<P>The interest surrounding agri-food is intense. The AgTech sector is pumping, and everyone from policy makers to producers to everyday consumers is talking about food, where it comes from and the opportunities that new technologies present. As governments rush to invest into the future of research and innovation, whatever that may look like or be, it is worth considering the current state of play. What do we have? What is the opportunity? And what do we need to do get there? There is no doubt that the flurry of activity has led to hype, which is generated from the proposed intersection of contemporary technology and technology start-ups with one of our oldest industries in agri-food. Whether it be precision agriculture, connectivity or blockchain, we need to consider if this technology is finding a problem or if it can be developed or modified to deliver a real solution.</P>
<P>This presentation will discuss the premise that transparency is coming to the food chain and in some form or another underpins most of the technological offerings and opportunities we have today. Transparency will not be negotiable, and stakeholders must be proactive in ‘turning the lights on’ in order to maintain the confidence of consumers and build trust. It is not a matter of only determining where your food comes from, but understanding how it may have been produced, processed and distributed. Leaving this task to those external to your supply chain could be catastrophic. Although this presentation will take a global perspective, with a focus on consumers, the supply and agri-food value chain, it will also explore the opportunities that are presented for Australia and its food producers. <BR></P>
