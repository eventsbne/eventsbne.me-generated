<p>We've got a big night planned this month, featuring four of Microsoft Brisbane's best cloud technologists!</p> <p>- Adam Stephensen joins us again to discuss Azure Application Centre.<br/>- Kris Bock will give us an introduction to Azure Databricks.<br/>- Fabrio Braga will discuss and demo the new and advanced analytic features of Power BI.<br/>- And Dale Austin will have a surprise Azure topic for us!</p> <p>NOTE: Because of renovations happening this month, this meeting will take place in the Hub instead of the theatre. Just follow the signs (and the pizza!)</p>
