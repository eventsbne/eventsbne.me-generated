<p>Join iOS/macOS/swift developers for our 'Appstravaganza' as well as the usual pizza, drinks and news.</p> <p>This month's focusses on ways to structure apps. Simon Stiefel from Atlassian is talking about using a Dependency Injection framework in a side project and Javan Wood from ResApp Health is reviewing the currently in-progress App Architecture book from objc.io.</p>
