<p>• What we'll do<br/>I am breaking with tradition with our meetup formula for a very good reason. A couple of weeks ago I was at the Brisbane Ethereum Meetup and Jack Tanner was a key speaker talking about the relationship between cryptocurrencies and the associated technologies - think Bitcoin and the Bitcoin Blockchain, Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin and so on. I was so impressed with the clarity of this presentation that I asked if he would be a BWiB guest. Lucky for us, Jack accepted.</p> <p>So I am going to run this meetup a bit differently. I am putting aside 15 mins for a Q&amp;A with Jack and then handing the floor over to him for his presentation. Here is a bit of background about Jack:</p> <p>Jack is a passionate advocate for Blockchain Technology and loves teaching technical concepts in an understandable way. Jack is a Blockchain Developer and Cryptocurrency Specialist. He recently completed a Masters in Computer Science at Imperial College London and a previous student at The Blockchain Connector Ethereum developer workshop. He currently works as a senior blockchain developer on the Indorse platform, and has been involved in numerous blockchain projects and education events. From Brisbane, Jack is enthusiastic to share his knowledge with his home two before returning to London.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>There won't be pizza at this one so please feel free to bring your lunch.</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>Brisbane Women in Blockchain Meetup has a code of conduct. I generally put aside 30 minutes from 12.00 pm to 12.30 pm for a networking lunch then from 12.30 pm to 1.30 pm for the Meetup and then 1.30 pm to 2.00 pm for more networking.</p>
