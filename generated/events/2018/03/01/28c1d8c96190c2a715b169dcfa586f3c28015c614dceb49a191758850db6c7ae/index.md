<p>Designed to bring women together from all sectors and backgrounds, from scientists and creatives through to coders and hustlers; we're reaching out to women keen to build their professional network in the tech and entrepreneurial space. Of course, the event is not limited to women and males keen to support women in the entrepreneurial space are more than welcome - as long as you're prepared to be out-numbered for once!</p> <p>The Cocktail Hour is a prelude to the main meetup and we would love you to stay - <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Artificial-Intelligence/events/247634291/" class="linkified">https://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Artificial-Intelligence/events/247634291/</a></p> <p>Note: the previous cocktail hours have been so much fun the Office of the Queensland Chief Entrepreneur is now taking the reins on this event. The cocktails are also proudly provided by the wonderful Chris Titley!</p>
