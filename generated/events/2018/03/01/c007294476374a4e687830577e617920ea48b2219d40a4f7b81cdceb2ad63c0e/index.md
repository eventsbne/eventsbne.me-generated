<p>The next installment of BrisPHP!</p> <p>We've got a couple of talks lined up but we're looking for more. If there's a topic you want to hear about or a you have something you'd like to talk about, post an issue on the GitHub page: <a href="https://github.com/BrisPHP/meetups/issues" class="linkified">https://github.com/BrisPHP/meetups/issues</a></p> <p>The talks don't have to be limited to "PHP", it can be any talk that PHP devs would find interesting. Currently scheduled talks:</p> <p>* What's new in PHP land? By Nathan Dench<br/>* Software Rewrites - The Company Killer by James Harvey</p> <p>This time we will be hosted at the CreditSense offices in the City, who have kindly offered to provide the space, drinks and food.</p> <p>Looking forward to talking about all the goodness that is PHP :)</p>
