<p>• What we'll do<br/>Playtesting is at the absolute centre of game development, and all too often smaller teams let it slip by the wayside at the time when it's most important. This talk, presented by Louis Van Dyke, is a broad overview of playtesting practices with particular attention to what has and hasn't worked in Louis' experience. You can expect to leave the presentation with a broader repertoire of playtesting tools and techniques, and a renewed appreciation for the ancient proverb: "test early and often."</p> <p>Tea and coffee will be served on the day, and we will be heading to The Fox afterwards for drinks.</p> <p>• What to bring</p> <p><br/>• Important to know<br/>Please note that due to JMC Academy’s OH&amp;S policy all attendees are required to wear enclosed footwear while on campus.</p>
