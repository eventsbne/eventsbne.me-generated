<p>A little over one week to go and we're all so EXCITED!!! We are working with two amazing change makers who make a real difference in our society who have great pitches ready for the weekend! The aim is for you, and everyone else in the room, to have allot of fun and walk away knowing you have made a real difference in our community!</p> <p>Who should come? - We need mobile app developers, programmers, website designers, privacy experts, information specialists, business analysts, project managers, management consultants, marketing experts and students in any of these fields of study! We all work as a team to make that difference that matters! Please sign up if your interested or share if you know of someone else who may also be interested: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/RHoK-Brisbane/events/247078973/" class="linkified">https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/RHoK-Brisbane/events/247078973/</a>.</p> <p>How it works? - On the Saturday morning our 2 x Change Makers will present an exciting, heart-felt pitch highlighting how they make a difference in the community, what their problem is and why they need you to help. After the pitches, we will start to form teams based on the skill-sets in the room and those required to solve each problem. You will be guided the entire time by two, energetic and motivated supervisors and also have a number of supporting tools to help turn problems into solutions. ðŸ™‚</p> <p>Then the rest of the weekend each team hacks away to make a minimum viable product that the change makers can walk away with by the end of the weekend. On the Sunday afternoon, each team will package up their solution and develop a showcase to present back to the room. We will have key representatives from industry at the presentations (from the IT space, not-for-profit space, corporate space). Checkout a video from our previous RHoK to see just how much fun we have: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/a8y9ip822yqv8q5/RHoK%20Brisbane%20Winter.mp4?dl=0" class="linkified">https://www.dropbox.com/s/a8y9ip822yqv8q5/RHoK%20Brisbane%20Winter.mp4?dl=0</a></p> <p>@rhokbrisbane<br/>@rhokaustralia<br/>#rhokbrisbane</p>
