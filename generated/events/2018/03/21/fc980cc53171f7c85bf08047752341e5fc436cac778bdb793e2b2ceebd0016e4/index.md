    Professor David Franklin @ IHBI\u00a0\nFeedforward and feedback learning in
    human sensorimotor control.\nProfessor David Franklin investigates the
    physiological and computational principles of human neuromuscular motor
    control. His research examines how the nervous system controls the
    mechanical properties of the body to adapt to our external environment and
    produce skilful movement. To examine the computations underlying
    sensorimotor control, he blends computational and experimental approaches
    including robotics and virtual reality.\nProfessor\u00a0 Franklin studied
    human physiology and was awarded a doctorate in neuroscience in 2005 from
    the Department of Kinesiology at Simon Fraser University (Canada). He worked
    as a researcher at the Institute for Advanced Telecommunications Research
    (Kyoto, Japan) from 1999 to 2006. He then spent 3 years as a research
    associate in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge
    (U.K.). In 2010 he was awarded a Wellcome Trust RCD Fellowship and became a
    research fellow at the University of Cambridge. He has been an associate
    professor of Neuromuscular Diagnostics at TUM since 2016.\nAbstract:The
    human sensorimotor control system has exceptional abilities to perform
    skilful action despite ever changing conditions. I will discuss how this
    adaptability can result through intrinsic feedback mechanisms in two
    different ways: sensory feedback driving feedforward adaptation; and
    feedforward adaptation in turn adapting the feedback responses and tuning
    them to the environment. \nIn the first part of my\u00a0talk\u00a0I will
    examine how prior sensorimotor cues can be used to learn independent motor
    memories. These results suggests that motor memories are encoded not simply
    as a mapping from current state to motor command but are encoded in terms of
    the recent history of sensorimotor states. However learning can also be used
    to adjust intrinsic feedback control. The second half of
    my\u00a0talk\u00a0will focus on a few recent studies examining feedback
    responses; demonstrating both how they are modulated for control and using
    them to probe the underlying mechanisms of visually guided reaching. Finally
    I will present work demonstrate that the visuomotor feedback gain shows a
    temporal evolution related to task demands (as predicted by optimal control)
    and that this evolution can be flexibly recomputed within 100 ms to
    accommodate online modifications to task goals.\n\nTime: 2:30pm-3.30pm
