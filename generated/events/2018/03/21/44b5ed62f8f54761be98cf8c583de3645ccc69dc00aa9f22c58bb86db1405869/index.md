<p>Hi Amazon Alexa Fans,</p> <p>We've been working behind the scenes to bring you a fantastic lineup of speakers, and we're pleased to announce that the first Alexa Meetup of 2018 is off with a bang! We're thrilled to welcome two of Amazon's very own Alexa Evangelists. We're looking forward to presentations from Jeff Blankenburg (Amazon US) and Azi Farjad (Amazon ANZ) on 'Alexa Entity Resolution.' Jeff will run through a live demo and run through the new developer portal.</p> <p>Coming all the way from the US, Jeff is an Alexa Evangelist at Amazon HQ in Seattle. Ultra passionate about technology, for more than 15 years Jeff has enthusiastically applied his technical expertise to build industry-changing websites and marketing efforts for a number of mega brands. He’s especially proficient in user interface design, web standards and mobile application development. Azi is a Developer Evangelist of Alexa Skills at Amazon here in Sydney. With specialties in User Experience Design and Human–Computer Interaction (HCI), she also has a passion for Mobile applications and Internet of things.</p> <p>Join us for pizza, drinks, and an awesome lineup of Amazon speakers. Please make sure to RSVP so that we can accommodate as many Alexa enthusiasts as possible, and bring photo ID for entry into the building. Please also ensure that your current Meetup name includes your first and last name/initial, as Amazon requires a list of attendees in advance.</p> <p>We're looking forward to a great evening!</p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Alana@Cloudten</p> <p>**************************************************************</p> <p>Learn more about Aibiliti - <a href="http://www.aibiliti.com" class="linkified">http://www.aibiliti.com</a></p> <p>Learn about Cloudten - <a href="http://www.cloudten.com.au" class="linkified">http://www.cloudten.com.au</a></p> <p>Do you want to develop a skill for Alexa?
