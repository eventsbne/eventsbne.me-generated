title: AR/VR Demo Session with Immerse Enterprises
date: '2018-02-28T10:00:13.510Z'

---
<p>At the last Healthtech Innovation meetup at The Precinct, I met up with Lex Van Cooten from Immerse Enterprises. We talked about AR/VR and what he was doing. Our minds went into overdrive when thinking about the different applications in enterprise. It was amazing (and we were one of the last to leave that night).</p> <p>We later met up at Firestation 101 in Ipswich to bring this demo session to you. Lex will talk about all of the cool things that AR/VR can do and then after the presentation, you will have the chance to experience it.</p> <p>A casual lunch and drinks will be provided as well.</p> <p>The agenda will be:</p> <p>Arrive for lunch - 12:00pm<br/>Presentation + Q&amp;A - 12:30pm<br/>Demo Session (open) - 1:00pm<br/>Finish - 2:00pm</p> <p>We are happy if you bring others to this event. Please include them on your registration.</p> <p>If you are not able to come, please let us know (by RSVP'ing as "Not Going") to keep catering as accurate as possible. We care about not wasting food.</p>
