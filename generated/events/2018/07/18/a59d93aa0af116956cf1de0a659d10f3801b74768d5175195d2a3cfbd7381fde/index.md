<p>We are extremely fortunate to have Marco Russo presenting at our next Power BI User Group. Marco also has got a Power BI Training Course happening in Brisbane from 18 - 20 July 2018 (<a href="https://www.sqlbi.com/p/mastering-dax-workshop-brisbane-2018/" class="linkified">https://www.sqlbi.com/p/mastering-dax-workshop-brisbane-2018/</a>)</p> <p>As usual, we will start at 5:30pm with some catering and the main presentation will start at 6pm.</p> <p>Below are the details about the topics that will be covered.</p> <p>Session Abstract:</p> <p>My Power BI report is slow: what should I do?<br/>You created a wonderful Power BI report, but when you open it you wait too much time. Changing a slicer selection is also slow. Where should you start analyzing the problem? What can you do to optimize performance?<br/>This session will guide you in analyzing the possible reasons for a slow Power BI report. By using Task Manager and DAX Studio, you will be able to determine whether you should change the report layout, or if there is something in DAX formulas or in the data model that is responsible for the slow response.<br/>At the end of this session, you will understand how to locate a performance bottleneck in a Power BI report, so you will focus your attention on the biggest issue.</p> <p>Presenter:<br/>Marco is a business intelligence consultant and mentor. He first started working on Analysis Services in 1998, back when Analysis Services was known as OLAP Services.</p> <p>A veteran of end-to-end projects, Marco wrote several books with Alberto Ferrari about Power BI, Analysis Service, and Power Pivot. They also regularly write articles and white papers that are available on sqlbi.com. Marco is a Microsoft MVP and an SSAS Maestro, the highest level of certification on Microsoft Analysis Services.</p> <p>Today, Marco focuses his time with SQLBI customers, traveling extensively to train and consult on DAX and data modeling for Power BI and Analysis Services. Marco also teaches public classes worldwide.</p> <p>Marco is a regular speaker at international conferences like Microsoft Ignite, PASS Summit, and Sqlbits. He also enjoys delivering evening sessions at local user groups during his trip</p>
