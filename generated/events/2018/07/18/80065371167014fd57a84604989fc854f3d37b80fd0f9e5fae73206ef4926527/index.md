title: 'Advanced Deep Learning: fast.ai Part 2'

<p>We will be running casual sessions to cover advanced deep learning content from fast.ai Part 2 (<a href="http://course.fast.ai/part2.html" class="linkified">http://course.fast.ai/part2.html</a>). These sessions will be held over 8 weeks, from the 18th of July to the 5th of September.</p> <p>The course covers the more cutting edge aspects of deep learning and topics will be drawn from recent research papers. These include object detection, attentional models, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), cycle GANs, semantic segmentation and more.</p> <p>We will meet weekly to recap the fast.ai lesson videos and run through the code presented there. It is expected for participants to have watched the week's video and attempted to re-implement the code from that video.</p> <p>While completion of Part 1 is not compulsory, you will need an understanding of these topics to get the most out of the course:<br/>- OO programming in Python<br/>- Experience with Numpy (Ideally Pytorch and Pandas as well)<br/>- Loss Functions (Cross-Entropy, L2 and L1 loss)<br/>- ReLU and softmax activation functions<br/>- Convolutions<br/>- Batch Norm<br/>- Dropout<br/>- RNNs<br/>- Categorical variable embeddings</p> <p>Bring yourself and a laptop!</p>
