title: Designing the special sauce for SaaS - Anna Harrison
date: '2018-07-02T13:50:15.454Z'

---
<p>Capturing the hearts of a fickle, globally distributed and diverse audience of swipers and tappers is not super easy. We live in a world where access to information is taken for granted, technology is seen as a birthright and brand loyalties can change at the flick of a download button. Any experienced Product Designer will know that product success is a volatile blend of art and science… and something that this talk is not at all about. What I will cover are the three factors outside of design and UX necessary to create the special sauce for SaaS products to succeed. The talk will be both practical and philosophical - so come with a roll of questions, or better yet, send them in beforehand to @shinyUX on Twitter.</p> <p>Dr Anna Harrison is an unusual thinker, who longs for only one superpower: the gift of another’s perspective. In addition to living an ordinary life in beautiful Brisbane, Anna also heads up the Product team at Scrunch - an outstanding crew of minds dedicated to creating new inroads into the unexplored territory of influencer marketing. Prior to Scrunch, Anna led a number of design teams to venture funding success, highlights of which include Tiny (raised $4m in 2018); TravellersBox (raised $10m in 2016); Tririga (acquired by IBM in 2011) and AdSpace Networks (raised $20m in 2007). Connect with Anna @shinyUX or scrunch.com</p>
