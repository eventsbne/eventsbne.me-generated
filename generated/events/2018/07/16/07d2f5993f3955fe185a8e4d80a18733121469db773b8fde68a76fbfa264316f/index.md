<p>Developing Enterprise Apps with ASP.NET Core 2.1<br/>=====================================================================<br/>Presenter: Jason Taylor (@jasongtau)</p> <p>The explosive growth of web frameworks and the demands of users have changed the approach to building web applications. Many challenges exist, and getting started can be a daunting prospect. Let's change that now.</p> <p>This talk provides practical guidance and recommendations. We will cover architecture, technologies, tools, and frameworks. We will examine strategies for organizing your projects, folders and files. We will design a system that is simple to build and maintain - all the way from development to production. You leave this talk inspired and prepared to take your enterprise application development to the next level.</p> <p>---------------</p> <p>Azure Functions for the Enterprise<br/>=====================================================================<br/>Presenter: Thiago Passos (@thiagospassos)</p> <p>Most people think Azure Functions are only for a tiny bit of code. They will be surprised! Why not build your whole application following best practices and only expose the endpoints through functions? In this talk, I'll present a new paradigm, a new way of thinking whilst still leveraging your existing knowledge.</p>
