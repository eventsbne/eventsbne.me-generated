<p>It's time for Game Development Brisbane's annual Lightning Talks, a series of rapid-fire talks on anything game dev.</p> <p>Speakers will do a talk for 10-15 minutes on a topic of their choosing. Anyone can speak so come and tell us about your favourite trick, engine, tool, API, dev process... you get the idea.</p> <p>If you are interested in representing, complete the form before 3 July:<br/><a href="https://goo.gl/forms/HEFqkJIAJwci3DSs2" class="linkified">https://goo.gl/forms/HEFqkJIAJwci3DSs2</a></p> <p>We will commence announcing speakers leading up to the event so keep a lookout on this page.</p> <p>*Marketing and understanding player motivations - Kaydos*<br/>Developers often leave marketing until the last minute and don't have a solid understanding of the core drives of their players. In this talk we dive into how marketing and game design can be interwoven from the beginning of your project.</p> <p>Kaydos is the Marketing and Community Manager for Damsel/Screwtape Studios. He also runs his own indie game marketing company known as Limit Break Marketing.</p> <p>*Optimal Reward Ratio - Cody J Phillips*<br/>A quasi-philosophical design goal Cody calls the "optimal reward ratio". The talk will discuss terms like "dynamic reward adjustment", and some grounded and speculative techniques towards achieving an extremely high level of player engagement.</p> <p>Cody is a game designer, educator, and founding member of QUT’s Games Research and Interaction Design Lab. Cody’s Ph.D. thesis explored the impact of video game rewards on player enjoyment.</p> <p>*History Game Design Process - Enrique Klein Garcia-Godos*<br/>History is a fascinating subject, when taught right, and games offer a fascinating platform upon which to explore worlds and events. This talk is about the key people and processes to put in place to develop a history based game.</p> <p>Enrique Klein is a Game Designer from Peru involved with educational games since the start of his career. He has worked at “Grupo Avatar”, the game research and development group the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru. During this time he directed, designed, documented and monitored educational game systems, mechanics, levels and narrative.</p> <p>*Good habits for successful software, programmer's perspective - Greg Douglas*<br/>Sharing some habits Greg has learned to make better quality software and manage risk.</p> <p>Greg has a passion for technology programming with a focus on interactive 3D. He's a game dev veteran who's been making software for decades. Greg is currently developing navigation and mission management software for aircraft.</p> <p>*Virtual Gunsmithy: Designing Guns and Gunplay for VR Shooters - Braycen Jackwitz*<br/>What makes a good VR gun? In this talk we'll take a quick look at everything that goes into making VR gunplay feel great, the balance of realism vs useability, and a dash of experimental concepting on better spectator experiences for VR shooters.</p> <p>Braycen is a VR gamedev and the founder of Pillow Head Games. For the past five years he's been on the forefront of VR development, experimenting and prototyping concepts and mechanics in the new world of VR. He's now applying his experimental nature to The Zero Dome, a VR survival arcade game set in zero gravity.</p> <p>*Game designing for adaptability with components - Dylan Ford*<br/>Knowing how to program is important for designers, but it's not uncommon to miss some of the design patterns which programmers will use when implementing your design. This talk will outline component-based design, from the designer's perspective, as a way to get the most out of what you ask of the dev team.</p> <p>Dylan is an organizer for Game Development Brisbane and a freelance game programmer/designer, as well as a tutor at QUT, and half of the team which created 'Alchemy Punch'.</p>
