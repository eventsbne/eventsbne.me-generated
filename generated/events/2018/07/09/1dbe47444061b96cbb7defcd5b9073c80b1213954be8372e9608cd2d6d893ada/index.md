<p>STATISTICAL SOCIETY OF AUSTRALIA QUEENSLAND ORDINARY BRANCH MEETING</p> <p>TIME: 6:00 pm for Free Pizza and drinks, talk at 6:30, Monday 9 July 2018</p> <p>COST: Free</p> <p>VENUE: Queensland University of Technology, Gardens Point, Z Block, The Gibson Room 1064</p> <p>TITLE: Tales from Far Off Places</p> <p>SPEAKER: Dr Steph de Silva, data scientist, Manager PwC</p> <p>ABSTRACT:<br/>Educated in theoretical econometrics at the University of Sydney, landing my first post-university job at the World Bank seemed like a perfect fit for me. But making the transition from theory to applied work wasn’t a natural progression. Working on projects for countries like Papua New Guinea, Laos, Tonga and Myanmar, I learned how to communicate with stakeholders who had led very different lives to me, to decide how the theory meets the practice and work out what to do when a flooded river disrupted my sampling scheme. This talk will be about some of the lessons I learned, the extraordinary people I met and how I learned to make the statistics work for the people and not the other way around.</p> <p>BIOGRAPHY:<br/>Steph is a data scientist who recently took up a role with a major consulting firm after practicing independently for a few years. She’s currently working out how having a boss works again, but luckily seems to have found a great team. Before moving into data science, she worked for four years with the World Bank with their early education team and prior to that completed a Ph.D. in theoretical econometrics at the University of Sydney. After a career spent largely tool-agnostic in the statistical computational sphere, she found R to be a consulting powerhouse and now helps organise two chapters of R-Ladies: R-Ladies Sydney and R-Ladies Remote.<br/>Membership</p> <p>Keep your community strong, SSA provides a place for networking, opportunities for professional development and accreditation.
