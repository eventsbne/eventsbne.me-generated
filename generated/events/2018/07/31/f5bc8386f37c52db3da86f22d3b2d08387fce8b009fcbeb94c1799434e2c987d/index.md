<p>About our Meetup group:</p> <p>Welcome to the Elabor8 Lunch and Learn Meetup group! We meet monthly on the last Tuesday of each month over lunch time.</p> <p>About the talk/workshop:</p> <p>Do you consider yourself a leader? We all have the potential to lead, and it doesn’t have to require the role. It all starts with how we approach leadership and what’s the mindset you need to live up to responsibility.</p> <p>This talk and workshop will explore what it means to be a leader, and how to prepare yourself each day for the challenge. Come prepared with an open mind and to share your thoughts on what leadership looks like.</p> <p>“Leadership is not about a title. It's about impact, influence and inspiration. Impact involves getting results, influence is about spreading the passion you have for your work, and you have to inspire team-mates and customers.” Robin S. Sharma - Writer and Motivational Speaker</p> <p>About the speaker:</p> <p>Ryan McKergow is the Group Manager - Queensland for Elabor8 where he is responsible for the overall operations of Elabor8's newest office and driving growth at a rapid pace.</p> <p>Previously as a consultant at Elabor8, he consulted at some of Australia's leading brands as an Agile Business Analyst, Agile Coach, and Scrum Master. He worked on a number Agile transformation programs to develop great teams, and enjoyed teaching and coaching them about the benefits of Agile.</p> <p>He is currently actively involved in building the Agile and IT community within Brisbane. He was one of the co-organisers for LAST Conference Brisbane 2017 (Brisbane's first Agile conference), ongoing co-organiser for the Agile Brisbane Meetup, and is a mentor for the QUT Career Mentoring Scheme.</p> <p>He has also presented at Conferences and Meetups where he loves to share his passion for Agile, Continuous Improvement, and Leadership.

West '16, 1st Conference '15 &amp; '16, LAST Conference '14 &amp; '15, Meetups, and many company presentations.</p> <p>About Elabor8:</p> <p>Elabor8 is a consulting company that helps speed the creation of customer value through a focus on people, teams and organisational<br/>agility.
