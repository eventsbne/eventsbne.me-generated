<p>Medical is a growth industry that concentrates around Brisbane. During this morning event we'll hear lightening talks from three practitioners who are growing medical products. They will share about key trends in the industry and mechanisms they're utilising to navigate their product to success within this ecosystem.</p> <p>Speakers:</p> <p>Michael Berndt<br/>Chief Customer Experience Officer<br/>eHealth Queensland</p> <p>With experience across a range of industries including finance, aviation, telecommunications and essential service utilities, Michael has a reputation for his thought leadership when driving customer-centric agendas. His passion is unearthing ‘what makes customers tick’ and the value that can be extracted by aligning people, systems and processes to better meet their needs.</p> <p>Dr Silvia Pfeiffer<br/>CEO and Co-founder<br/>Coviu</p> <p>With over 15 years of experience building new Web video solutions, Silvia has worked at leading corporations including Google, Mozilla, NICTA and CSIRO. Silvia and co-founder Nathan Oehlman spun Coviu out of the CSIRO in March 2018. Coviu is Silvia's second startup after a Web video analytics company. Silvia has a double degree in computer science and business management and manages sales, marketing, investments, and product strategy at Coviu.</p> <p>Elliot Smith<br/>CEO and Co-founder<br/>Maxwell Plus</p> <p>Founded in 2016, Maxwell Plus has an amazing story being an AI driven platform that leverages medical imaging, pathology and other data to help clinicians and researchers more quickly and accurately diagnose conditions such as Prostate Cancer and will soon also be able to support in diagnosing Lung and Breast Cancer. With a Doctor of Philosophy - PhD focused in Biomedical Engineering from The University of Queensland, Elliot will share his experience on road mapping and commercialising a medical device through it's initial growth curve.</p>
