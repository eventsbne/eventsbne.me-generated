<p>Thank you for everyone who attended the last meetup. It was great finally getting everyone from different companies together in one room and talking about mobile apps. For those who couldn't make it, please come to this one. We will meet after work at 6pm.<br/>NOTE: if you are looking for app development jobs, please come to meet the people who are always interested in hiring talented app developers.</p> <p>Agenda</p> <p>- Google I/O demo/recap<br/>Outware will give a talk on Google I/O demo or recap. It is Australia's leading mobile development company and has offices in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. The app they made for Qantas was also featured in Apple's WWDC this year.</p> <p>- Launch Festival recap<br/>Organiser of this meetup, Andrew, attended Launch Festival recently. This is the largest start up event in the world. He will give you a bit more info of this festival and share with you his experience.<br/><a href="https://www.launchfestivalsydney.com/" class="linkified">https://www.launchfestivalsydney.com/</a></p> <p>- Show and Tell<br/>One person will have the opportunity to present his app (prototype, personal app or commercial app) to the rest of us. This will be a great time for you to get some feedback or help with your app. Please message me if you are interested in this section. We'll choose 2 apps and 1 app will be a backup plan.</p> <p>As always, please let me know if you have any comments/suggestions/feedback for this meetup. Look forward to seeing you all.</p>
