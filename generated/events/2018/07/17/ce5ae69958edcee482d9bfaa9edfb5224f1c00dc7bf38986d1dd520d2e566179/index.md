<p><img src="https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/8/4/6/600_466150310.jpeg" /></p> <p>&gt; DATA VAULT 2.0 - Demystifying Data Vault 2.0 for Decision Makers</p> <p>Hosted by Julien Redmond, Nols Ebersohn, Peter Bankowski and Guest Speaker</p> <p>Come along, meet other data professionals, learn from their experience and gain a better understanding of how you can leverage Data Vault 2.0 to enhance business agility, improve accuracy and hugely reduce cost.</p> <p>&gt; As a decision maker, data is a two-sided coin.</p> <p>On one side, if you get it right then you can leverage your data to drive strategic decision making, new customer insights and create competitive advantage.</p> <p>On the flip side, poorly managed data can lead to organisational paralysis, bad decision making, legislative and compliance exposure, and in extreme cases, even organisational failure.</p> <p>Whilst enterprise data is a high-stakes topic, it is also very technical and complex. This leads to many decision makers delegating to their technical team and never fully understanding the business drivers that should be fundamental in the decision making.</p> <p>With a fast-changing landscape, both technologically and legislatively, it is vital that business decision makers understand the playing field. For example, The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) deadline is fast approaching. You may think you’re immune from its impact, but if you do business with customers in the EU, think again.</p> <p>&gt; And it’s not just compliance, data affects everything,</p> <p>This session is designed to bring together decision makers to discuss how they are managing the automation of their information management landscape, from both a people and process perspective. And how effective data governance and stewardship, combined with technological innovation such as Data vault 2.0 can ensure that when you flip the data-coin, you always come up heads.</p> <p>JOIN US, AND YOUR INDUSTRY PEERS AT DEMYSTIFYING DATA VAULT FOR DECISION MAKERS.</p> <p><img src="https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/e/f/9/600_466176601.jpeg" /></p>
