<p>On August 1st 2017, Bitcoin experienced a permanent hard-fork where it's blockchain split in two. This came as a result of disagreements in the Bitcoin community, on whether Bitcoin should be a store of value or cash.</p> <p>Although both chains share the same history, up until the hard fork, they now pursue separate scaling solutions. Bitcoin Core believes side-chains are the best way forward, while Bitcoin Cash has opted to pursue on-chain scaling through block size increases. Make no mistake, this is a winner takes all scenario that will ultimately result in the death of the inferior Bitcoin chain.</p> <p>At this event, you will hear our panel of Brisbane Bitcoin experts debate this topic and answer questions from the audience!</p> <p>House keeping: the venue can be hard to find for first timers. Entrance is off Queen Street Mall were the old Regent theatre was. Doors lock at 6:00pm, so please be on time. If you have a problem please call or text[masked]</p> <p>We will kick off the discussion at 6:30</p>
