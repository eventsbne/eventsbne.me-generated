<p>• What we'll do<br/>On August 1st 2017, Bitcoin experienced a permanent hard-fork where it's blockchain split in two. This came as a result of disagreements in the Bitcoin community, on whether Bitcoin should be a store of value or cash.</p> <p>Although both chains share the same history, up until the hard fork, they now pursue separate scaling solutions. Bitcoin Core believes side-chains are the best way forward, while Bitcoin Cash has opted to pursue on-chain scaling through block size increases.</p> <p>At this event, you will hear our panel of Brisbane Bitcoin experts debate this topic and answer questions from the audience!</p> <p>Speakers:<br/>BTC - Lucas Cullen &amp; Aleks Svetski<br/>BCH - Hayden Otto &amp; Brendan Lee</p> <p>House keeping: the venue can be hard to find for first timers.
