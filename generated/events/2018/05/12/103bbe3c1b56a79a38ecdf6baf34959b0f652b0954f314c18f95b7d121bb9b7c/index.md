title: Weekend Workshop - A "bring the washing in" Weather Station
date: '2018-05-09T05:38:35.466Z'

<p>• What we'll do</p> <p>Build a solar powered sensor that measures outside temperature and humidity, and also detects raindrops. It warns you when rain arrives, in time to get the washing in.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Bring a laptop computer.</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>There will be a cost of $60 per kit for this event that covers parts equipment and afternoon tea. Attendance will be limited to 8 kits. You may assemble your kit in a group for no extra charge (but let me know if so for catering)</p>
