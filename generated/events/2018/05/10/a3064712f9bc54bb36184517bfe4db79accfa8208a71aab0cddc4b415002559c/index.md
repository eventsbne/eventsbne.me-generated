<p>WordPress Inception - Starting a journey is just a single step. When we took those first steps in 2015 little did we know that we would be creating the core features that would one day turn into a WordPress-Ception.</p> <p>A WordPress website that gives birth to new WordPress websites.</p> <p>This talk will focus on the steps we took, deliberate and accidental, from a business and a tech perspective. We’ve just launched the MVP, and as it should, it needs work, we’re headed for something more desirable any day - and that’s the journey we want to share with you.</p> <p>Topic: WordPress Inception<br/>Location: River City Labs, Fortitude Valley</p> <p>How to access Building: Please note RCL has moved to 315 Brunswick St. Head to Brunswick St Mall, locate the "TCB Building" half way up and follow signs for "THE PRECINCT" (and the WordPress Meetup signs with red arrows), take the elevator to Level 3.</p> <p>We'd like to thank our sponsors for their ongoing dedication to the meetup:<br/>Conetix, Plesk, Excitemedia, and WP Engine.<br/>________</p> <p>6pm Doors Open, pre-event networking<br/>6.30pm Presentations start (Once people stop arriving, please enter quietly if you arrive after presentations start)<br/>7.30pm Pizza, Drinks, and networking.</p> <p>Getting here: River City Labs is located in the middle of Fortitude valley, walking distance from Buses and the FV train station.<br/>If you wish to drive, pre-booking Night Parking online for after 4pm is $8 (Drive up $15) at some of the secure parking locations - <a href="https://www.secureparking.com.au/en-au/offers-and-events/fortitude-valley-parking" class="linkified">https://www.secureparking.com.au/en-au/offers-and-events/fortitude-valley-parking</a></p> <p>The WordPress Brisbane group is run by a group of volunteers and relies upon the donations our sponsors make to the group for it to happen.If you'd be interested in helping us run the group in any form, sponsoring some of the costs of the meetup, or presenting on a topic you're passionate about, please get in touch - we'd love to hear from you!.</p> <p>The WordPress Brisbane meetup is scheduled for the 2nd Thursday of the month, every month.If you'd like to organise another WordPress-related event/meetup in Brisbane (and surrounds) for the group, get in touch so we can set it up!</p>
