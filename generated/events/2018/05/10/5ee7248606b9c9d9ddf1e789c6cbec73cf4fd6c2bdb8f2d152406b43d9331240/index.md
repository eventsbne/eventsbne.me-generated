<p>The legal profession has been relatively untouched by AI to date and even considered immune by some, but there are vast opportunities for AI to disrupt the legal system. Join Sam Soliman from Nerve Solutions Group and Samuel Irvine Casey from Max Kelsen as they discuss current and future applications of AI in legal practice.</p> <p>Sam Soliman will share how he came to AI to solve the challenges he sees in the legal system and the problem they chose to tackle first. Sam &amp; Samuel will present on a case study from the partnership between Nerve Solutions Group and Max Kelsen, with a deep dive into the models utilised. Using IBM Watson to extract data from legal documents and a range of predictive models, their first venture focuses on determining the likely outcome of a case.</p> <p>Looking to the future, Sam believes AI could completely change the way the legal system functions and will be discussing how they are preparing for it.</p> <p>About<br/>Nerve Solutions Group (<a href="https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/ERdRCJyp0PCql2qJsWlTVl" class="linkified">https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/ERdRCJyp0PCql2qJsWlTVl</a>) is a business and technology solutions consultancy with a passion for digital transformation.
