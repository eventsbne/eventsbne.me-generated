<p>The Presentation:</p> <p>Big data is one of those buzzwords that we’ve been subjected to for what seems like years now, but the hype hasn’t faded, in fact it is more relevant now than ever before. HDInsight is Microsoft’s big data offering through a managed service deployment of Hadoop. This makes it easier to query, ingest, and publish data and to create workflows that make sense for your organization. This talk will walk you through a high level overview of many tools in the big data world like MapReduce, HIVE, Pig and Spark and understand when to use what. Operationalising big data solutions could be a daunting task but by the end of this talk you will see how to automate the creation of Hadoop clusters, submitting jobs for execution, auto scale the cluster and tear down once done.</p> <p>Our Presenter:</p> <p>Yousry Mohamed is a senior developer working for Readify where his day to day tech stack covers everything from SharePoint to line of business applications running on both mobile and web. He is very passionate about all things data including Big Data, Machine Learning and Business Intelligence and likes to share this passion with his peers, clients and the wider community.</p> <p>Our Sponsor this month:</p> <p>AARNet Pty Ltd (APL) is the not for profit company that operates Australia's Academic and Research Network (AARNet).
