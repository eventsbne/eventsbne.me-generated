<p>Data Storytelling</p> <p>Data will not be remembered unless it is presented in a memorable way and the traditional approach of using a PowerPoint slide or a spreadsheet is not memorable; a story is. Data can be utilised to tell a meaningful story that resonates both intellectually and emotionally with an audience. Presenting data creatively can make numbers seem more human and turn statistics into stories.</p> <p>Too often data storytelling is interpreted as just visualising data effectively, however, it is much more than just creating visually-appealing data charts. In this presentation you will learn that data storytelling is a structured approach for communicating data insights and unlocking value in data which involves a combination of three key elements: data, visuals, and narrative.</p> <p>About the Presenter</p> <p>Peter Ward<br/>Managing Director, WARDY IT Solutions</p> <p>Peter Ward is an entrepreneur, investor and technology start-up mentor. Peter is a proud Queenslander who has successfully grown several technology investments that have been listed in the Deloitte Australia’s Technology Fast 50. Peter has been awarded the Pearcey Award for entrepreneurial ICT achievement and contribution and has also been named Brisbane’s Young Entrepreneur of the Year every year since 2010.</p>
