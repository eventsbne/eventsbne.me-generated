<p>Hi Nug-gets! Thanks again to Darren Smith from GHD for presenting at our March NUG. After 2 months to take a breath we have our foot back on the accelerator again and are very lucky to have another very special guest presenter for this NUG - James Redmond - Technical Support Engineer - Platforms &amp; Security - from one of our leading QLD based Service Provider partner - Digital Sense Hosting.</p> <p>James has been the NetApp champion at Digital Sense working with our technologies to provide a number of Next Generation services to their customers.</p> <p>Digital Sense Hosting has an extensive STaaS offering powered by NetApp. Over the years, the demand for and ratios of capacity and performance have changed dramatically, and our solutions have evolved to meet the needs of our customers.</p> <p>We have grown with FAS as our primary storage pillar to utilise AFF, StorageGrid and SolidFire. NetApp WFA provides automation, but OnTAP 9.3 has some new tricks too. There's more than one way to carve up storage, and we've tried most of them.</p> <p>This talk covers some of the experiences, technologies deployed, wins and lessons learned, and how we believe you could best transform your business to have a radical Storage-as-a-Service offering with NetApp as your foundation.</p> <p>Key Takeaways:</p> <p>- Contrast previous best practices to modern-day NetApp designs<br/>- Learn where to avoid unnecessary complexity<br/>- See how to best engage with a customer when talking about storage performance<br/>- Learn the way that Digital Sense has found to best offer performing NetApp storage.</p> <p>James will also discuss their direction around -</p> <p>- FabricPool<br/>- Reducing storage tiering Complexity<br/>- 9.3 Adaptive QoS.</p> <p>As always we'll also cover off all things new from NetApp, the DataFabric and new products and soltuions. But mostly importantly come and chat with your peers our "NetApp Ninjas!" and see how they are solving their challenges and what they have learned along the way.</p> <p>Please come with an open mind and be prepared to share. Only rule - No Sales Guys :)</p>
