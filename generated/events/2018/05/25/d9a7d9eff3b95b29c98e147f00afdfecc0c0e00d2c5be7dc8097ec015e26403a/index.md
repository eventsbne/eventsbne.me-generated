<p>It's been a few weeks since we hit the CBD, so we're sailing on down to Riverbar and Kitchen on the water at Eagle Street this week ‚öìÔ∏èüõ•</p> <p>---------------------------</p> <p>Welcome to the weekly support group for (digital) product designers.</p> <p>This group is for anyone interested in design, and how it applies to software, apps, web apps, and other digital products.</p> <p>If you're into UX, UI, interaction, brand, business strategy, or any of the myriad other topics we love to talk about, you'll fit right in ‚Äì but even more so if you're into all of the above.</p> <p>Our aim is to build a tighter design community in BNE by sharing our knowledge and gaining experience from outside of our regular teams and circles.</p> <p>This is a very casual affair. Just turn up, order breakfast or a coffee, and talk product design with some rad new people.</p> <p>Bring problems you're working through, or #designdrama topics to fire up a debate, or if you're hanging to get started, join our Slack (check the link below) and get some conversation happening early.</p> <p>We always look forward to meeting new faces, seeing familiar ones, and building a better, more connected design community in Brisbane.</p> <p>**You'll need to pay for your own food &amp; drinks.**</p> <p>Join our Slack: <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/productof/shared_invite/enQtMzI1MTcxODAxODQ1LWE5NjVhZmFhNzZiN2U0MTYwYTBjYTgxMGU4ZDY5Y2FjZmU1NGU0YTk2OTk2NzYzOGZkNGM3YWU4NmVmYzJiMWM" class="linkified">https://join.slack.com/t/productof/shared_invite/enQtMzI1MTcxODAxODQ1LWE5NjVhZmFhNzZiN2U0MTYwYTBjYTgxMGU4ZDY5Y2FjZmU1NGU0YTk2OTk2NzYzOGZkNGM3YWU4NmVmYzJiMWM</a></p>
