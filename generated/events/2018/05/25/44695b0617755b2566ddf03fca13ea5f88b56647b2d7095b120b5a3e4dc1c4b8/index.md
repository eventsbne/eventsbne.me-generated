<p>WordPress will be 15th years old this May 27th, 2018!<br/>To celebrate, over the weekend WordPress communities around the globe will be holding celebration parties and meetups.</p> <p>As the 27th is a Sunday, Brisbane is going to celebrate early on Friday, May 25th instead!</p> <p>Everyone is invited to come along to River City Labs (our usual venue) to enjoy some refreshments (and maybe even a WordPress birthday cake) and celebrate 15 years of WordPress. We'll be sharing our party photos and love for WordPress with the rest of the world via the hashtag #wp15.</p> <p>Don't forget to spread the word, let's make this WordPress birthday memorable :)</p>
