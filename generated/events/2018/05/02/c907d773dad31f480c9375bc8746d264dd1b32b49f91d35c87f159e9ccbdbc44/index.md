<p>It's time for the Brisbane alchemists to get together and geek out over all things Elixir, with pizza and drinks provided by our sponsor Stacktrace!</p> <p>It's been a while since our last meetup, so we'll kick off with some Elixir news.</p> <p>Next up, Aaron will share his experience creating a GraphQL API with Elixir and Absinthe.</p> <p>Mike will dive into GenStage and how it makes building Producer-Consumer systems in Elixir a breeze.</p>
