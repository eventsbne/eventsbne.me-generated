<p>Do you want to learn how to code and develop web applications for Ruby on Rails and have no idea where to start? Or, are you a company that has staff that need to get up to speed on Ruby on Rails?</p> <p>You are invited to attend the Ruby on Rails InstallFest, an initiative by reinteractive (<a href="http://www.reinteractive.com/" class="linkified">http://www.reinteractive.com/</a>).</p> <p>What is it about?</p> <p>This is your opportunity to get your laptop or computer set up with a full Ruby on Rails development environment. Most importantly, it's a FREE service!</p> <p>Bring your Windows, Mac or Linux PC, our team can help get you running on any of these.</p> <p>Once your laptop is set up, we get you building your own blog powered by Ruby on Rails. By the end of the three-hour workshop, you should have this up and running, online and published on the Internet.</p> <p>Wait, what do I bring?</p> <p>The only requirement is you bring your computer along with whatever power charger you need, and also, please, make sure your computer works :) Power boards will be provided, everything else is up to you.</p> <p>OK, I need one more incentive. How about free food?</p> <p>Yes, reinteractive (<a href="http://www.reinteractive.com/" class="linkified">http://www.reinteractive.com/</a>) will be providing pizza and drinks for you to enjoy while you are getting your system up and running.</p> <p>I'm a professional Rails Developer, can I help mentor?</p> <p>Yes, we are always looking for experts to come along and help :-) Just send us an email ([masked]) or RSVP to let us know you'd like to come along.</p>
