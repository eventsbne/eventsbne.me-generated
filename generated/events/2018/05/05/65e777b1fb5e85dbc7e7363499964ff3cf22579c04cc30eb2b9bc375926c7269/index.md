<H2>What is Angular Hack Day?</H2>
<P>Angular Hack Days are for Developers or people who want to learn Angular.</P>
<P>There will be something for everyone, experienced Angular developers can share ideas with other experienced developers. If you’re a beginner then there’s plenty to learn on the day.</P>
<P>It’s recommended that attendees bring their own laptop on the day with Angular already setup and installed. If you’ve never played with Angular before it would be good to do a little bit of learning before the day but it’s not a requirement as all are welcome.</P>
<H2>What should I bring?</H2>
<P>Bring a laptop on the day with Angular already set up and installed so we can dive straight into it. Also bring your love of learning and questions for our experts.</P>
