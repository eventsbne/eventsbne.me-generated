Dr. Ball was the Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) technical lead for international company URS within Australia and New Zealand, and led the delivery of URS’s first Beyond Line of Sight RPAS project in Australia in 2013. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;As a sought after voice in industry, Dr. Ball is working across a diverse portfolio of projects including unmanned systems (aerial, terrestrial, and aquatic) for environmental monitoring. In particular, her most recent works include the provision of technical support for innovation and new technology within existing monitoring frameworks for the oil and gas industry, marine and environmental monitoring, international development, capacity building, business plan advisory, and data management practice improvement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;Dr. Ball’s big passion is working on Projects that have a humanitarian aspect, from use of RPAS for emergency response, to recording cultural heritage, and agricultural assessments. Dr. Ball has travelled and worked extensively in sub-Saharan Africa and Australia on some cutting edge projects that combine science, entrepreneurship, empowerment, and ongoing education. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;Dr. Ball has over 15 years’ experience in handling complex data sets from various environmental conditions and resolutions. Her experience includes soil microbial ecology using molecular techniques, as well as surveys in fluvial, freshwater, forest, intertidal and marine ecosystems.
