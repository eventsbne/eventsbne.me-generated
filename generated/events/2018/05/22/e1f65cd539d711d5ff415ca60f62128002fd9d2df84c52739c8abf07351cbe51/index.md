<p>After the flurry of talks in March we had a little break to catch up and now we're back! This time we're welcoming back Andrew Ramsden who came and chatted to us at the start of 2017.</p> <p>This time Andrew's topic is on one of Designer's soft skills - influence. Here's the summary:</p> <p>There's nothing worse than design by committee. Even God knows your pain, how do you think we ended up with the camel or the platypus?<br/>Unfortunately, even when you're the design lead, UX is a game everyone believes they can play, regardless of how much skill and experience they actually have. Your best weapon is your influence. So, how influential are you? Can you bring people around to your point of view and retain them on your side? It's not easy. We're going to talk through why we need to think about more than just research and rationale, the three main modes of influence and how you can apply them.</p> <p>And in case you've forgotten who Andrew is:<br/>Andrew Ramsden specialises in leadership development for technical professionals. He has more than 15 years experience in technology and digital including roles in front and back end development, interaction design, customer research and customer experience strategy. While taking opportunities to stay 'on the tools' whenever possible, Andrew transitioned into leadership positions and has successfully led large-scale digital strategy and whole-of-government digital transformation programs. Andrew now runs a business developing technical professionals into leaders to increase their influence, impact and income.</p> <p>While junior UXers are more than welcome, this topic is aimed specifically at those Mid to Senior people that are moving from just 'doing' work to having a larger voice at the table.</p>
