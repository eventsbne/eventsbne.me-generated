<p>• What we'll do<br/>Let's party on International Bitcoin Pizza Day.<br/>Celebrating the $20 Million Pizza Order.</p> <p>It's the eighth-year anniversary of the first Bitcoin transaction, in which a Florida man paid for two pizzas with the cryptocurrency. The day has become part of folklore, not because of the transaction, but more the price: the man in question paid 10,000 Bitcoins.</p> <p>Come &amp; join us for some not so expensive pizza, a few drinks &amp; some good conversation about digital currency.</p> <p>Venue will be announced soon.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>A friend, some good crypto conversation &amp; networking cards.</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>RSVP Via This Site ;)</p>
