<p>This is our regular weekly meeting. It's the best meeting for new people to come along to, as most members attend this meeting.</p> <p>You don't need to be a member to attend this, feel free to come along and socialize, meet people and talk about awesome ideas.</p> <p>If you arrive at the space and there is no-one around, fear not. We sometimes head down the road to grab a bite to eat at about 7 and generally all head back to the space after that to keep hacking into the night.</p> <p>Keep an eye out for this signage, and when you arrive, drive down to the end of the driveway and to the left to find the entrance and carparking. Feel free to call[masked] if you have any issues finding us!</p> <p><img src="http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/6/0/2/event_454902498.jpeg" /></p>
