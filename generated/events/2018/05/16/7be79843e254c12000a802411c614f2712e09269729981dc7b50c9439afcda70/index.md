title: Computational Design of Folded Structures with Joe Gattas & Co. @ Arup
date: '2018-05-04T05:38:30.370Z'

<p>Folded sheets create intuitive physical analogue models from which computational design methods can be learnt or applied. This philosophy is basis for research at the UQ Folded Structures Lab (UQ FSL), who seek to adapt geometric sheet patterns to invent and improve folded structures and devices. Joe Gattas will present some of the computational design capabilities and recent projects of the UQ Folded Structures Lab, with particular focus on parametric design, generative design, and digital fabrication techniques.</p> <p>Current and recent graduates of UQ FSL will also have short presentations on their computational design tools:<br/>Weiqi Cui: '3D Scanning for design and defect analysis'<br/>Jonathan Tan: 'Algorithmic design of timber buildings'<br/>Quan Shi: 'Digital Fabrication Toolbox for folded steel and press-fit timber construction'</p> <p>Bios:<br/>- Joe is an origami engineer and Senior Lecturer at the University of Queensland. He leads the ‘Folded Structures Lab’ research group, founded in 2014 at UQ after completion of his Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Oxford in 2013. The group comprises six PhD candidates and 15 Undergraduate/Master’s thesis students, with $1.2 million in active projects across timber engineering, origami engineering, and digital fabrication.<br/>- Weiqi is a PhD candidate at UQ. Her research focuses on curved-crease folded structures and FRP-timber thin-walled structures.<br/>- Jonathan is a Graduate Engineer in Building structures team at GHD. During his time at university, he focused on developing parametric design tools for timber design as part of his final year thesis.<br/>- Quan is a PhD candidate at UQ. His current research is about origami structures with specific interests in folded steel and thin-walled structures.</p>
