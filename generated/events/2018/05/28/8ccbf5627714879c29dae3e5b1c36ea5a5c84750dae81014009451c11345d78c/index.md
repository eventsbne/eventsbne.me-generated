<P><SPAN>What others say about the training and trainer;</SPAN></P>
<P><STRONG>Daniel R Tuma, Senior Systems Analyst at Cleveland Metro Schools, United States</STRONG></P>
<P>I spent probably about two weeks looking for a good Microsoft Power BI class that would cover all of the aspects of the program. I wanted to walk away from the class being able to apply what I learned immediately. Most training companies that I looked into were in a state of flux with Power BI mostly due to the transitions that Power BI itself was going through. Then I stumbled on the RADACAD web site. Reza Rad touted a course that he taught named “Power BI, From Rookie to Rock star.” If the class was indeed an A to Z course, then it was exactly what I was looking for. The class outline seemed to include every topic on my checkoff list plus much more. I decided to give Reza a try.</P>
<P>Reza completely lived up to his hype. He took us through a natural progression of the software, using example after example of how to complete a task. We went through real world scenarios, a bare minimum of two scenarios for each minor topic. I was completely impressed with his Power BI knowledge, understanding and abilities. Any question we came to Reza with was answered completely and with even more examples.</P>
<P>After the class, my goal of immediately applying what I learned was attained. Right away I was able to successfully pull and massage data, create useful reports and post them to dashboards.</P>
<P>I would recommend Radacad Power BI Training without hesitation.</P>
<P><STRONG><SPAN>Jeffrey Weir; Independent Consultant, Wellington, New Zealand</SPAN></STRONG></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal">I learned a lot from this course: it gave a great overview of what's possible both right from the UI, and what more awaits if you lift the hood and pimp the engine. It’s incredible to see just how much PowerBI and PowerQuery radically simplify what I would otherwise have to do with many, many lines of complicated VBA code. And Reza is a masterful user of this tool.</P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal">Note that Reza covers a lot of ground in this course, and it is pretty fast paced. While you can take a laptop and follow along as Reza takes PowerBI/Powerquery through its paces, for the one-day course my recommendation would be to keep that laptop closed, and simply sit back and watch Reza in action, so you can fully concentrate on just how simple this tool is to use in the right hands as well as think about how you might use the tool to your own ends and ask questions along those lines. You can always purchase the video course (if it’s not already included in your course) and step through the material again at your own pace.</P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><STRONG>Rob Wilby; Independent Consultant, UK</STRONG></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal">I must say your “Power BI Essentials” course has been the most comprehensive Power BI course I have found to date and seeing how you work with data especially the little tricks naturally introduced at just the right moments has made this course a pleasure to take.</P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><STRONG>Martin Catherall – Data Platform MVP, PASS Regional Mentor</STRONG></P>
<P>I attended Reza’s Power BI pre-con “From Rookie to Rock star” at SQL Saturday Brisbane in May 2016. I was a complete Power BI novice, having only previously accomplished a few very basic things with Power BI. Reza took the group through all the components that make up environment. He explained how they had evolved and took the group through walk-throughs of each one. Reza was great an answering questions from the audience at the event and going into extra detail if necessary. All-in all, I would say that I’m now a very confident Power BI user after attending Reza’s pre-con.</P>
<P><STRONG>Dan Cheshire, Senior Project Manager Air New Zealand</STRONG></P>
<P>Reza does not just know Power BI like the back of his hand, he is the most commercially aware BI person I know.  He understands that companies work in the real world and that data isn’t always clean and needs manipulation for it to work and be useful.  When Reza worked on our project, nothing phased or flustered him, he always came up with solutions for problems that seemed to me as insurmountable.  Can’t recommend him enough, invest in Reza as he will not only save you a whole heap of time, but he comes up with long lasting and very powerful Power BI solutions for your business.</P>
<P><STRONG>Sonia Buckley, Data Analyst at Zoom2u, Sydney, Australia</STRONG></P>
<P>We have started to use Microsoft Power BI and whilst Microsoft tutorials are helpful, if you are not used to DAX then it is very difficult to get your head around and there is little other resources that don’t cost an arm and a leg.  I had a call with Reza who made my life so much easier in just under an hour!  Any time spent speaking to Reza will be well worth it – I have saved hours of trying to get my head around our dashboards by getting some very useful tips and explanations on why things are done the DAX way!  Not only that but he is very patient and straight forward.  Highly recommended!</P>

<H2><STRONG>1.3: Power Query for Data Transformation</STRONG></H2>
<P>Data analysis and BI world starts from data extraction and transformation. Power Query is the data transformation engine of Power BI. Power Query comes as part of Excel 2016, or as an add-in for Excel 2013 and 2010. Power Query is also part of Power BI Desktop. In this module you will learn about all different version of Power Query, their similarities, and differences, as well as configuration and requirements of using them.</P>
<P>Power Query uses a graphical user interface to apply transformations on the dataset. However Power Query works with a functional scripting language behind the scenes. The key to learn Power Query is learning the functional language called M. There are many features in M that are not available in the Power Query GUI. In this module you will learn how to understand M, and how to write M scripts even from scratch. You will learn writing custom functions in M as well as many other useful features.</P>
