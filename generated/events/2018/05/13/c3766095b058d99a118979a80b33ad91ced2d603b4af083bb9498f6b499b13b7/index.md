<p>Sunday Coder Club is a great chance to work on projects, discuss technology and learn about other people's work. We work through the afternoon until about 5pm and have dinner as a group. Please bring your laptop, else you will find yourself at a loss for activities.</p> <p>Our events have seen projects like reverse engineering of NFC cards, ports of software to new languages, 2d video games, restaurant booking applications and more.</p> <p>Fear not, you don't need to be a "11/10 full stack ninja hax0r" to attend! We have many people who are there to learn html, ruby, new frameworks, and to connect with our positive community. We want to encourage all levels of skill to attend this workshop. You do need to bring your own ideas and projects, because this is a working group where we are all doing self-directed tasks.</p> <p>We kick off the afternoon with an agile style stand up, where we all share what we are working on. After some hours of work and fun we have a humorous debate over where we are going for dinner, and then we probably get Burritos anyway.</p> <p>Let's pool our resources and talent and have fun while building cool stuff. Bring your laptop, your own projects and community spirit.</p>
