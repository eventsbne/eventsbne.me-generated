<p>We have two presenters who are very well known in the Power BI space in town and they will each present on separate topics. Please join us to learn from Reza Rad &amp; Leila Etaati.</p> <p>As usual, we will start at 5:30pm with some catering and the main presentation will start at 6pm.</p> <p>Below are the details about the topics that will be covered.</p> <p>Presenter: Leila Etaati<br/>Topic: Create Power BI Custom Visual using R and JSON Scripts<br/>Abstract: Power BI visualization is a holistic visualization tool. You can draw most of the popular charts with it. However, there is always some needs for specific charts that may not be available in Power BI standard visualizations or in the Power BI marketplace. There is a possibility to extend the visualization capabilities using R language. There are two ways to use R to extend the visualization possibilities. The approach was introduced in 2015 as “R” custom visual that you can draw chart by writing R scripts. The editor for writing R was not that was good and also the end-user able to see the R code behind the chart. The second approach for using R to have more chart in Power BI has been introduced in 2017 that is about creating Custom visual file (pbiviz file) using R and JASON language. In this session, I am going to show how you can create any custom visual by writing R codes. You able to create a custom visual that has a specific icon, name, and parameters, and fields. All the steps to create custom visual will be explained and demonstrate.</p> <p>Presenter: Reza Rad<br/>Topic: Row Level Security Patterns in Power BI<br/>Abstract: Security is different from Sharing, Sharing is about sharing the entire content with others, security is about authorizing different views of the content to others. In this session we go through many different Row Level Security patterns; Static Row Level Security, Dynamic Row Level Security, and many variations of the dynamic RLS, such as giving manager access as well as employee access, you will learn about user profile security scenarios, and hierarchical access levels. This session shows you how DAX and Power BI security comes together to play an important part of a Power BI project lifecycle: Row Level Security.</p>
