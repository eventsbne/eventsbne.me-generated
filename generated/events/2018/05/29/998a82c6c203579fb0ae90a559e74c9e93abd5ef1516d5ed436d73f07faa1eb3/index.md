<p>Hello Elastic Fantastics,</p> <p>Now that we've all recovered from the royal wedding, we can forget about royal and noble ranks for a while and instead learn more about relevancy ranking!</p> <p>For our next meetup we'll have Jimmy presenting on research into the BM25F similarity ranking algorithm with Elasticsearch, using emprical data to help you make reasoned decisions for best relevancy. Dr Guido, a senior lecturer at QUT's Electrical Engineering and Computer Science School, will also start us off with a brief intro into the BM25 &amp; BM25F algorithms.</p> <p>If you've done something interesting with the Elastic stack and want to share a demo or presentation as a lightning talk (or something longer) then let us know and we'll see about slotting you in either at this meetup or next. We'll probably have some adhoc presentations on the night either way.</p> <p>Also remember to bring your questions/queries about the Elastic stack to discuss on the night. RSVPs close at 23:00 (11pm) on Monday the 28th of May, so get in quick to ensure your spot because the meetup is next Tuesday night and the venue has limited spaces.</p> <p>We look forward to seeing you all there!</p> <p>The meetup Room P504 is in P block, second floor coming from the main entrance of P block, in front of old government house.<br/>See map: <a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/dir/''/-27.4779996,153.0292135/@-27.4778631,153.0285378,19z/data=!4m2!4m1!3e0" class="linkified">https://www.google.com.au/maps/dir/''/-27.4779996,153.0292135/@-27.4778631,153.0285378,19z/data=!4m2!4m1!3e0</a></p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>The Elastic AU Team</p> <p>Also if you want to do some reading up on Similarity Ranking algorithms and BM25 beforehand, see the recent Elastic 3-part blog post series:<br/><a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/practical-bm25-part-1-how-shards-affect-relevance-scoring-in-elasticsearch" class="linkified">https://www.elastic.co/blog/practical-bm25-part-1-how-shards-affect-relevance-scoring-in-elasticsearch</a></p>
