<p>Lots of great content this month. We've moved the date due to some building maintenance that has been extended. Sorry for any inconvenience.</p> <p>* Andrew Birch will be presenting on how to use the new version of MVVMCross, version 6.0.<br/>* Build will have run in the US and we'll no doubt there will be plenty to discuss about the announcements there (lots of work for Ryan)<br/>* Our normal news and updates</p> <p>This will be lots of fun, its great having Andrew present and we'll see you there</p>
