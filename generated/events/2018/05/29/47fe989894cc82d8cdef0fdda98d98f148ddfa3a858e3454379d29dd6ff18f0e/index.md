<p>About our Meetup group:</p> <p>Welcome to the Elabor8 Lunch and Learn Meetup group! We had a really great launch in 2017 and are excited to bring you more in 2018. We'll be meeting monthly on the last Tuesday of each month over lunch time.</p> <p>About the talk:</p> <p>Thinking Wide - An introduction to Systems Thinking/Theory of Constraints.</p> <p>In organisations we are often told to think big, to go big or go home. But is this really the best approach? Where do businesses need to apply their efforts to get big improvements from change.</p> <p>This talk will serve as an introduction to System Thinking/Theory of Constraints. And how it can help us find the bottlenecks that prevent us from achieving more.</p> <p>Systems Thinking is a systemic approach to looking at the organisation as a whole, while Theory of Constraints gives us a framework and set of tools to exploit limitations and to get the most for our resources.</p> <p>About the speaker:</p> <p>Shay McAulay is a Senior Consultant for Elabor8, he has spent many years in all parts of the Software Development Life-cycle and likes to bring his Agile-based problem solving to bear on any problems, looking for improvements and simplification to improve processes.<br/>He has worked in a number of different industries from Finance and Insurance to Central and Local Government through to e-commerce and on-line gaming.</p> <p>He is also a Professional Scrum Master and Developer and has experience as an Agile Coach.</p> <p>About Elabor8:</p> <p>Elabor8 is a consulting company that helps speed the creation of customer value through a focus on people, teams and organisational agility. Our whole-of-business approach is focused on building knowledge, uplifting capability and identifying efficiency improvements across technology, product innovation and design, agile delivery and advisory.</p> <p>Lunch provided:</p> <p>We will be providing sandwiches and wraps to enjoy while listening to the talk.</p>
