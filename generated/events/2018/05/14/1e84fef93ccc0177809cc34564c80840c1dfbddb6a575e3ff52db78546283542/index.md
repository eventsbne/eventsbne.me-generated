We ran a poll to see what people wanted to hear, check it out here: <a href="https://twitter.com/BrisJS/status/992259606435909633" class="linkified">https://twitter.com/BrisJS/status/992259606435909633</a></p> <p>📈 Fixed Mindset vs Growth Mindset - Jordan Morris<br/>A short presentation on the damaging effects of a fixed mindset and how you can foster a growth mindset in development and other areas of life.</p> <p>😎||🙅 Rad Or Bad? The Javascript quiz with Kory Nunn<br/>Are you across the latest JS features?
