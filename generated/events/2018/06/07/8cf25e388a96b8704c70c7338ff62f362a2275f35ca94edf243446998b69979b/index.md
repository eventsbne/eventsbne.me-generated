<p>This month we have a special event in that we're flying Alyce Katsanos up from Sydney to give us a preview of her Agile Australia talk!</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>This session is not a ticket to financial services bliss, it’s about what keeps me coming back, the rush I get when I make it out the other side, people intact and the business in a better place.</p> <p>I’ll be honest, there are times when the Risk, Regulator and Restructure trifecta makes me yearn for my free and easy piano teaching days! Regulators, increasing compliance, restructures and the belief that ‘Agile can fix everything’ even when an Agile mindset is not well understood has made working in financial services a tough gig.<br/>This session is not a ticket to financial services bliss, it’s about what keeps me coming back, the rush I get when I make it out the other side, people intact and the business in a better place. It’s a peak into my world and how I’ve learned to navigate the chaos, governance overload, and constant influx of unreasonable and immovable dates whilst managing my own internal fear of failure.</p> <p>On a happier note, it’s also about me sharing my insights on how to make good decisions in complex systems. I manage to have a laugh and celebrate the success of accomplishing more in three months than some expected to happen in years.</p> <p>About Alyce Katsanos | Scrum Master, Program Coach, Senior Consultant, Elabor8:</p> <p>A Senior Consultant at Elabor8, Alyce Katsanos has spent the last 12 months working in the Insurance and Financial Services sectors. Her admittedly unusual career trajectory, from piano teacher, to technical writer, to Agile practitioner, brings a unique perspective and set of skills to coaching.</p> <p>Pragmatic in her approach, it’s Alyce’s honesty, passion and ability to deliver successful outcomes in the most unlikely of situations that simultaneously keeps her teams happy and stakeholders trusting. What makes Alyce tick is her ability to find fluid, collaborative and effective ways to work in constrained environments that sometimes make people feel like they’re drowning in a sea of red tape.<br/>Known by everyone she works with for always having a cup of coffee in her hand, she’s established a reputation for finding solutions that give people, teams and organisations the freedom to move.</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>• 5:30 - 6pm - Arrive early for some food provided by Elabor8, grab a drink at the rooftop bar and head into the Charlotte Room for a chat</p> <p>• 6 - 7pm - Agile Australia Preview - Trials of the financial services trifecta - Alyce Katsanos - Elabor8</p> <p>Our sponsors:</p> <p>Thank you to Elabor8 (<a href="https://elabor8.com.au" class="linkified">https://elabor8.com.au</a>) for being the main sponsor of the night and their ongoing sponsorship for Agile Brisbane Meetup.</p>
