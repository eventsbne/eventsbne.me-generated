<p>Jobs Theory is a powerful tool to interpret why businesses fail and succeed, and can assist in building competitive strategies for businesses.</p> <p>This meetup will frame Jobs Theory around how a startup can become more competitive by closely aligning to their customers' intrinsic needs to "make progress".</p> <p>Jobs Theory, by Prof. Clay Christensen (Harvard), has been developed over the past 20 years and is now a powerful predictive theory for business growth and success. He explains Jobs theory with the McDonalds Milkshake example: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEFAHIulWw4" class="embedded">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEFAHIulWw4</a></p> <p>In this Meetup we will cover:</p> <p>- What is Jobs Theory?<br/>- Examples on ways to grow your startup<br/>- Interactive Q&amp;A</p> <p>The content for this presentation is based on Harvard researchers: Clayton M. Christensen, Taddy Hall, Karen Dillon, David S. Duncan.</p> <p>There will be a "sales flavour" to this presentation, as most startup founders need to be able to pitch their product.</p>
