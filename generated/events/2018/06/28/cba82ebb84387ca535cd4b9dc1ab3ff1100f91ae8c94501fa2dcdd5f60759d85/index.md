<p>THIS IS A PAID EVENT - PURCHASE YOUR TICKET IN THE LINK BELOW<br/><a href="https://www.startupgrind.com/events/details/startup-grind-brisbane-presents-meet-tim-walmsley-of-benchon-welcome-to-the-future-of-work" class="linkified">https://www.startupgrind.com/events/details/startup-grind-brisbane-presents-meet-tim-walmsley-of-benchon-welcome-to-the-future-of-work</a> <b>In Tim's own words:</b>&lt;/p&gt;"I have seen firsthand the pain that small business owners feel when they have to let go of valuable staff because there was a gap in a contract and they could not afford to keep them on. Why do we accept employee underutilisation as a common business practice? Let's end the waste, improve our bottom line and put our workforce to work"&lt;/p&gt;<b>Learn about the Future of Work in June!</b>&lt;/p&gt;Tim's company also recently raised a round of capital ($650,000) so they can drive his vision of a well utilised workforce to the next level. We will learn about the challenges from his recent capital raise and how he overcame them at our fireside chat.&lt;/p&gt;<b>What does BenchOn do?</b>&lt;/p&gt;"At BenchOn, we believe that idle staff are wasted staff. Employee underutilisation is costing the Australian economy billions each year in lost productivity. Within knowledge and talent based industries, which are heavily contracts or projects based, underutilisation increases costs, reduces job stability and decreases business growth. To address this problem, BenchOn has developed a SaaS marketplace solution that matches idle staff to short-term contracts from reputable companies and Government Agencies.&lt;/p&gt;Through BenchOn, organisations can manage the peak demand/low demand business cycle more efficiently and effectively, by maximising employee productivity in low demand periods and providing access to the hidden talent inside Australia’s best organisations to assist during the peak demand periods. &lt;/p&gt;Organisations can now pre-emptively manage their employees’ availability throughout the year with our easy to use interface. BenchOn allows organisations to create employee profiles for all of their staff and quickly nominate periods of underutilisation for each individual throughout the year. BenchOn will then match short-term contracts to each employee’s availability based on their qualifications, skill sets and experience.&lt;/p&gt;Organisations, through their BenchOn Company Profile, can also submit short-term job requests. Businesses and organisations with available staff that meet the requirement will then be matched to the job submission in priority order. The matching process prioritises internal staff to the organisation first, and then appropriate matches throughout industry and academia based on how well they meet the criteria of the position. Through this process, BenchOn is breaking down industry boundaries to find the most suitably qualified person for the job, regardless of the industry they operate in. BenchOn then takes care of the contracting and administrative paperwork to further reduce the burden on the organisations involved."&lt;/p&gt;Look forward to hearing more about your journey, Tim!&lt;/p&gt;</p> <p>Agenda<br/>5:30 pm: Networking and food<br/>6:00 pm: Fireside chat<br/>7:00 pm: More networking!<br/>7:30 pm: Wrap up</p> <p>---</p> <p>Speaker<br/>Tim Walmsley - BenchOn (CEO)<br/>In Tim's own words: "I have seen firsthand the pain that small business owners feel when they have to let go of valuable staff because there was a gap in a contract and they could not afford to keep them on.
