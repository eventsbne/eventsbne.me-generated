<p>Apologies on the lateness to publish the schedule as we've had difficulty in getting confirmations on talks. This description will be updated ASAP during the week as we get close to the event!</p> <p>Enjoy presentations by our great speakers, pizza and drinks, as well as the opportunity to network with your peers.</p> <p>---------------</p> <p>Schedule:<br/>6:15 PM - Arrive &amp; mingle - wait at Gallery Level elevators for security to let you up (same level as the train station)<br/>6:30 PM - Welcome &amp; introductions feat. Kevin Vanderbeken<br/>6:45 PM - Talks begin‚Ä¶</p> <p>‚ú≥Ô∏è Decoding Design - Anna Harrison<br/>Given that there are about 22 million developers in the world, it is likely that the billions of regular tappers and swipers of the world will not at all be just like you. Building a product for people like you, therefore, greatly limits the size of your total addressable market - which in short, is really bad business. We know that startups co-founded by designers are far more likely to succeed. But why is this? What exactly do these mysterious Design Creatures do, and more importantly, what can you learn from them to help your product win the tapping and swiping game? How can your development work succeed in the market?</p> <p>‚è≤ Fast functional frontends in Elm and Javascript - Christopher Biggs<br/>Elm is a lightweight functional language for the browser that compiles to javascript. Most elm tutorials show you a hello world or a small single page app and leave you at that. This presentation gives a brief introduction to elm and then dives in to how to integrate with existing<br/>"heavyweight javascript" code such as oAuth providers, and mapping engines.</p> <p>üìÜ The monthly Top10 .JS<br/>Back again... our rapid-fire overview of the top ten blog posts / cool JS things of the month (in a short lightning talk)!</p> <p>‚ú® Potentially more / Lightning talks - TBA!</p> <p>---------------</p> <p>‚ùì Why not volunteer to speak next time?<br/>Have you got something to say?
