<p>6.00pm: Beer and Pizza<br/>Drinks and venue are sponsored by Acquia <a href="https://www.acquia.com/" class="linkified">https://www.acquia.com/</a><br/>Pizza is sponsored by TEstudIO <a href="https://tomato-elephant-studio.com/" class="linkified">https://tomato-elephant-studio.com/</a><br/>Very occasionally we have a sponsor for this - but generally we just try to recover the minimal cost of these - so bring some cash to throw into the 'honesty-box'.</p> <p>* * MEETUP STARTS * *<br/>6:30pm - Drupal Presentation I:<br/>Topic: Exporting RDF data for Custom Content Types in Drupal 8<br/>by: Paul Firth<br/>A brief presentation on the state of RDF integration in Drupal 8 and the on-going development of a new tool to help improve and simplify the linking of Custom content types with available semantic web ontologies. The presenter Paul is a Griffith University undergrad IT student on industrial placement at the CSIRO working on Semantic Web tools.</p> <p>7.00pm - Around-the-Room Intro's</p> <p>We put this as our second item on the Agenda so that late-comers don't miss out! This section is one of the most valuable parts of our meetup in terms both of building the Drupal community, and for networking to learn who is working on and has skills or experience in what things.</p> <p>Three elements: (1) Name; (2) Drupal role &amp; context in ten words or less; &amp; (3) something interesting in Drupal or other webtech that you've been working on lately.</p> <p>7:15pm - Drupal Presentation II:<br/>Topic: To be advised<br/>by: Pending</p> <p>7:45pm Community Feedback or Lightning Talks<br/>We don't want to use up much Meetup time on this but, depending on what activities are being planned for Qld Drupal networking, promotion and training we may have some elements needing broader yet concise consultation &amp; feedback. When not need this time will be supplanted by any lightning talks participants might be able to offer. No pressure!</p> <p>8:00pm - Drupal Presentation III:<br/>Topic: To be advised<br/>by: Pending</p> <p>8.30pm - Finish &amp; Networking Time:</p> <p>All welcome to stick around to continue the conversation over another beer.</p>
