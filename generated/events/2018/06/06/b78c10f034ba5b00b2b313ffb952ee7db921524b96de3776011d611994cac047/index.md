<p>Dr Stephen Gay has recently been invited to present a webinar to Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy on improving Excel use amongst scientists and engineers. This talk will be a live presentation on this topic and will discuss a broad range of techniques such as colour styles, named ranges, arrays, flowcharting, etc. with the purpose of making spreadsheets error-free, understandable, automated and understandable. (the topics are covered in more detail within a 3 day professional Excel course) (<a href="http://www.excelengineering.com.au/" class="linkified">http://www.excelengineering.com.au/</a>)</p> <p>The meeting will be organised once there are a large number of people (greater than 30) indicating interest.</p>
