How are you encouraging, linking, managing and tracking your cross channel activity? </b>&lt;/p&gt;At this event we’re looking at how marketers are using cross channel marketing to drive consumers towards purchase. With customers frequently switching from desktop to mobile, from website to Facebook to email to instore, we need to frequently review how these channels are working consistently and together.&lt;/p&gt;We’ll explore how linking channels can increase conversion and look at creative ways that organisations are moving their customers from one channel to another. Our speakers will also discuss the latest approaches and tools to track multiple channel movements, attribute sales and bring customers back to buy again and again.&lt;/p&gt;<b>This event will cover:</b>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How offline and online channels can best work together to encourage engagement and purchase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The best practice multichannel attribution measures and tools&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Examples of successful multichannel campaigns&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Regardless of whether you have a physical location, an online-only offering or a mix of the two, this topic will help you to ensure you’re considering the multi-channel approach that your consumers are using.&lt;/p&gt;<b><a href="#react-event-purchase-root">Get your ticket now.</a></b>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<b>Inclusions:</b>&lt;/p&gt;This event is a seminar event and includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The opportunity to network with attendees (8:00 - 8:30am)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tea, coffee and a light snack will be served during the networking time&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The audience will sit (theatre style) to listen to the presentations&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We will have three speakers each presenting for 20 minutes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Question and answer time will be held at the end&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All attendees will automatically enter our business card draw on the day to have a chance to win great prizes!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;<i>References: <a href="https://www.cmo.com.au/brand-post/content/610020/report-reveals-the-channels-that-really-influence-consumer-purchase-decisions/">CMO</a></i>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our Speakers&lt;/h2&gt;<b>Renee Smith, Head of Marketing at Cotton On Group&lt;br&gt;</b>Renee will share how Cotton On Group place relationships at the centre of their multichannel approach, including the success of their recent Mother's Day campaign that drove Instagram followers directly in-store.
