<p>What does it take to delight your customers and prospects, and keep them coming back? In the craziness of the always-on digital world we live in today, all customers, regardless of industry, public or private sector, are looking for fast answers. Not waiting on the phone, downloading apps or chasing URLs. The rise in artificial intelligence (AI) and conversational platforms is changing the game, in terms of how organizations can interact with their customers to the point that enterprise interactions can be just as seamless and “delightful” as arranging to meet a friend for coffee.</p> <p>Advances in AI, machine learning (ML), and natural language processing (NLP) coupled with the rise in conversational platforms such as Messenger, Kik, WhatsApp, and Snapchat are fuelling the significant growth, anticipated in the global chatbot market. Through Chatbots and conversational assistants, organizations can significantly reduce operating costs and more importantly they can consistently deliver superior levels of service that can dynamically scale based on business requirements.</p> <p>This session highlights the meteoric rise of messaging platforms, and shares real world Aussie examples from higher education and retail including University of Adelaide and National Pharmacies. John will share our recipe for success using Oracle Intelligent Bots and the proven Rubicon Red delivery methodology, rollout cycle and messaging as a platform reference architecture. You will learn how to best get started with your own chatbot projects, so you too can raise the bar on your own customer experiences, in just 4-8 weeks.</p> <p>John Deeb</p> <p>John Deeb is the CEO and Co-founder of Rubicon Red. Since founding the company in 2009, John has focused the company's efforts on leading customers to success in their Oracle Middleware and Oracle Cloud Platform journeys.
