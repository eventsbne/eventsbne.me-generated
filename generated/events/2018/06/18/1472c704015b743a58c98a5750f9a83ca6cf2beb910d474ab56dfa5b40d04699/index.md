<p>• What we'll do<br/>We're taking a break from meetups for May, but we're back in action for June! Come and listen to some quality speakers, network with other frontend devs, and chat about all the cool things going on in the React ecosystem.</p> <p>As always, the meetup is great for both newbies &amp; veterans alike. There's free beers &amp; pizza provided. Talks start at 6:30. Feel free to arrive any time after 6:00.</p> <p>-- AGENDA</p> <p>* Talk 1 – TBD</p> <p>* Talk 2 – TBD</p> <p>-- SPONSORS</p> <p>Beers and venue sponsored by Rexlabs</p> <p>Pizza sponsored by Just Digital People</p> <p>-- BECOME A SPEAKER</p> <p>Want to give a talk? Let us know via Meetup messenger or post a Github issue:<br/><a href="https://github.com/ReactBrisbane/meetup/issues" class="linkified">https://github.com/ReactBrisbane/meetup/issues</a></p> <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>Street parking can be pretty tricky, so it would be a good idea to allow extra time if driving. There is 2 hour free parking nearby at Gasworks.</p> <p>If you choose public transport, the venue is close to the Teneriffe Ferry Terminal and buses. The front door will be open for the event.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Nothing (though a laptop can be useful)</p>
