<p>On the 15th of May Bitcoin Cash gets a major upgrade. We will look at the markets and explore what new opportunities come for the developing BCH economy when transactions are limitless and cheap.<br/>So far we don't have any fixed discussion topics, but as always we will go through the basics of using Bitcoin Cash and have extensive Q&amp;A.</p> <p>What to bring<br/>• Mobile phone<br/>• An open mind</p> <p>Please download a Bitcoin Cash wallet. We recommend Bitcoin.com, download it at <a href="https://wallet.bitcoin.com" class="linkified">https://wallet.bitcoin.com</a>. After the meetup there is always a social event where fellow BCH enthusiasts can shoot the breeze on topics far and wide.</p> <p>Important to know<br/>• The Brisbane Bitcoin Cash meetup is funded in part by the Bitcoin Cash Fund with money being used to provide refreshments and to give meeting attendees small amounts of BCH to demonstrate wallet functionality. To learn more about the Bitcoin Cash Fund, please visit <a href="https://www.thebitcoincash.fund/" class="linkified">https://www.thebitcoincash.fund/</a></p>
