title: Test Driven Development in Unity

<p>Test-driven-development has taken the software development world by storm, and is generally accepted as the best way to ship quality software. In spite of this, it remains under-utilised in indie game development. This is exacerbated by the fact that Unity’s API is not structured in a way that makes it easy to test – it encourages code that is tightly coupled together and lacks the features to support mocking. Is automated testing really worth it for indie game dev?</p> <p>In this talk we’ll be dispelling myths about automated testing for games and exploring how we can use it to reduce bugs, iterate and add new features more quickly. As well as the details on how to implement unit and integration tests in Unity, we’ll look into how to fit automated testing into your development pipeline, when tests can best help us, and when different approaches may be better.</p> <p>This talk will cover:<br/>• How automated testing can be used on an indie game<br/>• Different types of testing and parts of a game that can be tested<br/>• Implementation of unit tests in a Unity game<br/>• Development methodologies that help you get the best value from your tests</p> <p>The strategies presented in this talk will be based on those used from products shipped at Real Serious Games, and code samples for everything in the talk will be available on GitHub.</p> <p>Rory Dungan has been building things with Unity for over four years. Currently he uses it every day at Real Serious Games, working on projects ranging from VR experiences on the Rift, Vive, Gear and Oculus Go to tablet apps and engineering visualisation tools. In his spare time he sometimes works on game projects and currently maintains a couple of open-source editor extensions and libraries.</p>
