<p>We're back with another in-person meetup in Brisbane. This time we have an excellent presentation, followed by a game.</p> <p>Lana Brindley will present on "Facebook, Dynamite, Uber, Bombs, and Tech Writers: A quick historical excursion through ethics and documentation." It's expanded from her recent lightning talk at the WTD Remote meetup. [Content warning for some mild swearing]</p> <p>Following Lana's presentation we will be playing Pictothesaurus*, a game in which each player represents a technology or documentation term in pictures, while all other players must try to guess the term. White board markers and white board will be provided. BYO drawing talent.</p> <p>* If I recall correctly, Lana thought of the name for the game, to avoid copyright issues. :)</p> <p>We look forward to seeing you there.</p>
