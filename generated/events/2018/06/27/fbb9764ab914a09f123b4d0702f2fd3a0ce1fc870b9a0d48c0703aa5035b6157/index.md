<p>We're back with another in-person meetup in Brisbane. The format will likely be the usual, with two presentations or activities, followed by social chat.</p> <p>Presenting tonight will be Lana Brindley on "Facebook, Dynamite, Uber, Bombs, and Tech Writers: A quick historical excursion through ethics and documentation." . It's expanded from her recent lightning talk at the WTD Remote meetup. [Content warning for some mild swearing]</p> <p>There will be time for another presentation, so let us know if you're interested. The topic should relate *somehow* to documentation but all ideas will be considered. First-time speakers are especially welcome. Anyone looking to practice a presentation they are preparing is welcome to come along as you'll have a captive audience. Either reply here or message either of the organisers here on Meetup.</p> <p>We look forward to seeing you there.</p>
