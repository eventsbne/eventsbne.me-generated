title: How to Apply Jobs To Be Done Theory
date: '2018-06-10T05:38:31.499Z'

<p>It has been a while between drinks - and it is June already.</p> <p>We have a great presenter lined up to help the Product Management community in Brisbane explore and discuss the 'Jobs to be Done Theory'. David Herse has recently presented on this topic in Sydney and has a real passion for it.</p> <p>➡️ Theme of Talk<br/>How can we create products that bring real value to users? Why do users choose one product over another? How do some products manage to disrupt and innovate while others stay stagnant? The answer lies in the ‘job’ a user is hiring a product to do. This is called 'Jobs To Be Done' Theory.</p> <p>'Jobs To Be Done' Theory is centred around a clear understanding of a customers’ struggle and the progress they seek in a given circumstance. A well-defined job offers a kind of innovation blueprint. To create products of real user value, Product Managers need to fundamentally understand the reasons an individual chooses to pull a product into their lives. This talk discusses how to uncover a users ‘job’ and apply it to the product design process.</p> <p>➡️ About Our Discussion Lead<br/>David Herse is the Product Manager of Five Good Friends, founder of Userology and co-founder of jobstobedone.pro. He has over 10 years experience in UX, Product Design and Product Management. David applies his experience with Jobs-to-be-Done Theory to uncover customer struggles and turn them into product opportunities.</p> <p>➡️ Venue<br/>Our friends at QSuper are hosting this event. Please note, the address is:<br/>- Level 1, 70 Eagle Street, Brisbane</p> <p>➡️ Schedule<br/>Plan to arrive at 5:30pm<br/>Discussion starts 6:00pm<br/>Snacks and drinks on arrival</p>
