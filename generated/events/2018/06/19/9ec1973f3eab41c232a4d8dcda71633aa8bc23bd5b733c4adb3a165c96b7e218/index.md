<p>## What we'll do</p> <p>We'll have a couple of talks, have some drinks and pizza's and chat about microservices and apis.</p> <p>## Talks:</p> <p>* API Access Management Overview - Benefits of Centralised Auth, OpenID, OAuth<br/>* Kubernetes - All the (API) resources you need to know before your first deployment<br/>* Distributed transactions - Donâ€™t do them! Also, this is how to do them</p> <p>Talks start at 6:30. Feel free to arrive any time after 6:00.</p> <p>## More Talks!</p> <p>We've got room for some lightning talks and everyone is interested in how others have solved or are solving some challenges around microservices and apis (or both). If you've got an idea for a talk (5 minutes - 40 minutes) for this event or the next one please submit here: <a href="https://github.com/brisbane-api-meetup/events" class="linkified">https://github.com/brisbane-api-meetup/events</a>.</p> <p>## What to bring</p> <p>Yourselves!</p> <p>## Important to know</p> <p>Street parking can be pretty tricky, so it would be a good idea to allow extra time if driving. There is 2 hour free parking nearby at Gasworks.</p> <p>If you choose public transport, the venue is close to the Teneriffe Ferry Terminal and buses. Front door will be open for the event.</p> <p>The door will be unlocked until 7:30 - when you get here just pull!</p>
