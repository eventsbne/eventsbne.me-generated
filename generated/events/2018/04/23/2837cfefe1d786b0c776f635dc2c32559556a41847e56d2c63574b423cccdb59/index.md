<p>Unit Tests with EF Core SQLite<br/>================================================================<br/>Presenter: Jernej Kavka (@jernej_kavka)</p> <p>When trying to test applications functionalities, sometimes we need to verify that the data flow correctly, technically an integration test.</p> <p>While EF Core has In-Memory DB, it does not have all of the functionalities required to properly test.</p> <p>We’ll dive deep into SQLite, why should you use it for unit testing and why should you avoid it.<br/>_________________________</p> <p>Full Stack Reactive Programming<br/>=====================================================================<br/>Presenter: Brendan Richards (@BrendanSSW)</p> <p>Like many developers, Brendan first started using reactive patterns with RxJS and JavaScript-based user interfaces.</p> <p>But reactive programming is a pattern that can apply in many more places and Reactive libraries have been released for many languages – including Reactive Extensions for C#.<br/>This talk explores using Reactive Extensions on the server side under ASP.NET Core.</p>
