<p>We're off and running for 2018!</p> <p>**What organisations are doing to nurture and grow a culture of high-performance** with Marcio Sete</p> <p>**Topic Abstract**<br/>The status quo seen in organisations today includes low cooperation across groups and a culture of blame, information is often withheld for personal gain and responsibilities are compartmentalised by departments, with little concern for the overall mission of the organisation. The flip side of it, where an engineering culture is in place, we have good information flow, high cooperation and trust, bridging between teams, and conscious inquiry. Organisations who are actively evolving their engineering effectiveness are achieving the ability to promote small and frequent changes, creating a culture of learning.</p> <p>High-performing IT Organisations are experiencing a noticeable increase in throughput, predictability, visibility, stability, quality, business responsiveness, happiness, sense of purpose and professional pride. At the same time they are decreasing risk, cost of maintenance, disruptive variability, failure rate, time to recovery, lead time, queue time, time to learn, burnout, turnover and rework.</p> <p>In terms of data, the 2017 edition of the State of DevOps Report says that High IT Performers are deploying software 46x more frequent, their change failure rate is 5x lower, their lead time for changes is 440x faster and their mean time to recover (MTTR) is 96x faster.</p> <p>They also spend 26% less time on unplanned work and rework and 44% more time on new work. Their employees are 2.2x more likely to recommend their organisation as a great place to work and 1.8x more likely to recommend their team to a friend as a great working environment.</p> <p>This conversation will explore what organisations are doing to nurture and grow a culture of high-performance.</p> <p>**Speaker Profile**<br/>Marcio is an experienced technologist, working in the software industry since 1997, with excellent track record helping organisations build and operate well-crafted software by compounding principles and practices of Software Craftsmanship, DevOps and modern management.</p> <p>Currently, Marcio is growing the engineering capability at Elabor8, helping organisations to evolve their engineering effectiveness using a value-centric approach aligned to their unique context, objectives and concerns.</p> <p>**Sponsors**</p> <p>Thanks to Elabor8 and CUA for sponsoring this meetup - see <a href="https://elabor8.com.au/" class="linkified">https://elabor8.com.au/</a><br/><a href="https://www.cua.com.au" class="linkified">https://www.cua.com.au</a></p> <p>**Opening Times**</p> <p>We're open at 5:30 for a 6:00 start.
