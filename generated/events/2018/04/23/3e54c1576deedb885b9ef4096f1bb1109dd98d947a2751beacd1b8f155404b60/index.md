<p>• What we'll do<br/>Come and listen to some quality speakers, network with other frontend devs, and chat about all the cool things going on in the React ecosystem.</p> <p>As always, the meetup is great for both newbies &amp; veterans alike. There's free beers &amp; pizza provided. Talks start at 6:30. Feel free to arrive any time after 6:00.</p> <p>-- AGENDA</p> <p>* Talk 1 - An Overview &amp; Discussion of React 16. (30 mins, Aaron Williams)<br/>React 16 adds a suite of new features, as well as replacements for deprecated features, for developers to take advantage of. In this talk Aaron will explore some of these new features, giving examples on how they can be used and explaining why they were introduced in the first place.</p> <p>* Talk 2 - React Suspense (20 minutes, Julian Burr)<br/>With all the awesome stuff that we got with React 16, what does the future of React look like? Building on Aaron's talk, Julian will take a sneak peak at one of the probably most hyped features of React 17: “suspense”. What is it and why should everyone get excited about it?</p> <p>* Talk 3 - Goodbye WordPress, Hello React (20 minutes, Thomas McCarthy)<br/>Static sites are fantastic, but they come with their fair share of limitations when trying to use them for basic brochure websites. How do you handle things like form submissions? How do you non tech-savvy clients easily update content? Tom will walk through setting up a basic static site with Gatsby, hooking it up to Netlify CMS, and setting it up for automatic deployment, getting all the benefits of a modern React workflow combined with the client friendliness of something like WordPress.</p> <p>-- SPONSORS</p> <p>Beers and venue sponsored by Rexlabs</p> <p>Pizza sponsored by Just Digital People</p> <p>-- BECOME A SPEAKER</p> <p>Want to give a talk? Let us know via Meetup messenger or post a Github issue:<br/><a href="https://github.com/Brisbane-React-JS/meetups/issues" class="linkified">https://github.com/Brisbane-React-JS/meetups/issues</a></p> <p>All our speakers are now rewarded with a React T-shirt thanks to Glen from FunCaptcha :)</p> <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>Street parking can be pretty tricky, so it would be a good idea to allow extra time if driving. There is 2 hour free parking nearby at Gasworks.</p> <p>If you choose public transport, the venue is close to the Teneriffe Ferry Terminal and buses. Front door will be open for the event.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Nothing (though a laptop can be useful)</p>
