Content writing and creation is hard. It's time consuming and it can be painful.</p> <p>And then once you have spent all this time on writing what you think is the perfect piece of content. NOTHING. NADA. ZIP. Zero. Sad face.</p> <p>You keep chipping away because that's what everyone tells you to do ... but one day, you can't take it any more and you just want to give up. Or if you do have some luck, it doesn't last very long and it's back to the crickets again.</p> <p>- Your content doesn't rank well in search.</p> <p>- No one is reading it.</p> <p>- If they do read it, you are worried you'll get negative comments.</p> <p>- You don't feel confident in putting yourself out there.</p> <p>- You don't know what to write about, how to write it or who to write it to.</p> <p>- It's taking waaaay too much of your time.</p> <p>- No leads and definitely no sales.</p> <p>- Gosh, you probably don't even know where to start.</p> <p>Don't worry, I've been there too, let me assure you.
