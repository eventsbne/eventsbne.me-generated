<P>Tanda Hack is back with the 2018 Tanda Hackathon!</P>
<P>Some people said it couldn't be done, but we took those people, threw them into a proverbial box, stood outside the box and laughed manically. This year we're back but with a bit of a twist, instead of focusing on a particular technology, the theme for this hackathon is <STRONG>Employee Experience</STRONG>. So come along and build something that will make the lives of employees 10x better.</P>
<P>This year, you'll be competing for two prizes:</P>
<P>- The Tanda Hackathon Trophy for best validated and executed project<BR>- The Tanda Tech Award for best technical project<BR></P>
<P>Bring your best Blue Steel because the Tanda Hackathon Selfie Comp will be making a grand return. We'll have our timeclock out Friday night, gasoline fight photos welcome (Tanda not to be held accountable for any freak gasoline fight accidents).</P>
<P>Your ticket gets you free food, drinks, and a place to work for the entire event. All you need is a laptop &amp; charger. And as usual, <STRONG>all ticket proceeds will go back to IT and programming clubs at local universities</STRONG>.<BR></P>
