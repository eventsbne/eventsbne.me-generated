<p>We will be joined by Unity Evangelist John Sietsma who will run us through the newest Unity features including the Shader Graph editor and Scriptable Render Pipelines as well as any other features you'd like to ask about.</p> <p>Unity[masked] brings new levels of control and flexibility. One of the coolest features coming in[masked] is Shader Graph which helps you create a range of shaders; flowing lava, gooey slime mound, beautiful lakes, flashing LEDs, and more!</p> <p>A Shader Graph enables you to build your shaders visually. Instead of hand writing code you create and connect nodes in a graph network. You can do things like:</p> <p>• Procedurally alter your surface appearance</p> <p>• Warp and animate UVs</p> <p>• Modify the look of your objects using familiar image adjustment operations</p> <p>• Change your object’s surface based on useful information about it; its world location, normals, distance from camera, etc</p> <p>• Expose Properties to the Material Inspector, so that you can quickly tweak a shader’s visuals in the context of a scene.</p> <p>• Share node networks between multiple graphs and users by creating subgraphs.</p> <p>• Create your own custom shader graph nodes through C# and HLSL</p> <p>The graph framework gives instant feedback on the changes, and it’s simple enough that new users can become involved in shader creation.</p> <p>The Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP), introduced in[masked] beta, (<a href="https://unity3d.com/unity/beta" class="linkified">https://unity3d.com/unity/beta</a>) is a way of configuring and performing rendering in Unity that is controlled from a C# script.</p> <p>SRP aims to redefine how Unity does rendering at all levels. Up until now rendering in has been very strictly defined by Unity. There was of course hook points into the engine to modify behaviour, but it was quite limited. SRP is opening up the rendering engine inside Unity to you!</p> <p>John Sietsma combines a long history as a games developer with a love of education to help people make the most out of Unity. He has worked on games that let people fly planes, play Rugby League, conquer kingdoms, merge the real with the virtual and compose music by waving their arms around! A personal highlight has been teaching new game programmers the skills needed to enter the world of game development.</p>
