<p>Here is what the meetup will look like:</p> <p>We will talk about different ICOs, in a structured format and will facilitate an open discussion about the merits of each project, allowing you to identify and distinguish between good and bad projects, how to make sure you aren't contributing to scams, and hear a varied selection of opinions from the other participants.</p> <p>Our team will be there to moderate and share their insights from their experience in this space. You will, of course, be able to ask any questions you might have and we will be happy to answer them. We want to make sure this is an active community where you don't just come to listen but participate and learn by doing and discussing.</p> <p>We will let you know one week in advance about the structure of the event and the ICOs we will discuss.</p> <p>We look forward to seeing you there - there is a lot to learn!</p> <p>The Blockchain Reserve Team.</p>
