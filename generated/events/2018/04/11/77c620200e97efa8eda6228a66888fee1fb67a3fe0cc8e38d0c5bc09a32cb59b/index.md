<p>Please come join us for our monthly robotics meetup!</p> <p>It is going to be a night of informally talking, eating and drinking.<br/>We'll be chatting about robotics, science, business and just your next crazy ideas! The idea is to meet fellow people interested in robots, from building small ones to big industry robots!<br/>So come join us for another night of robo-revelry. This is inspired by Silicon Valley's BotsNBeer events (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Silicon-Valley-Robotics/events/154195152/" class="linkified">http://www.meetup.com/Silicon-Valley-Robotics/events/154195152/</a>)</p> <p>As always, feel free to bring your ideas and robots to show off! We'll open the floor for project introductions and pitches.<br/>Hope to see you all there!</p> <p>A Dropbox Paper was started to create a bit better communication flow between meetups, if you have projects, ideas, jobs that you want to announce, discuss or just spread the word about put them here: <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/-brisbane-robotics-interest-group-cMfOglD62rVisfFij5RR7" class="linkified">https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/-brisbane-robotics-interest-group-cMfOglD62rVisfFij5RR7</a></p> <p>Venue is going to be tbc (most likely in the cbd, fall back is the QUT robotics lab but we are looking for others to host us as well!)</p>
