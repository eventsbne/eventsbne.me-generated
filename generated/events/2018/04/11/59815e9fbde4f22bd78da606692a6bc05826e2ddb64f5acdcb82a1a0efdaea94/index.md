I started Octopus in my spare time in 2011, and today it's grown to $10M a year in revenue, with 20,000 customers and employs 40 brilliant people. My background is in software development, but the best part of running Octopus is all the different things I need to learn as the business grows."</p> <p>Join us at 6pm for a 6.30pm start.</p>
