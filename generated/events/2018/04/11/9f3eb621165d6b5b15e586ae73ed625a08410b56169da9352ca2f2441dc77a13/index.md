<H2 CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN><SPAN>Collaboration for Industry Impact – Deep Dive Workshop</SPAN></SPAN></H2>
<P><STRONG>Time and Date  </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Day 1: <STRONG>11 April 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM <BR>Day 2: 12 April 9:00 AM to 12:30 PM</STRONG></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><STRONG>Price: $750 for non-members, $500 for members. Contact Jordan.Gardner@crca.asn.au for the discount code. See if you are a member <A HREF="https://crca.asn.au/members/supporting-members/" TARGET="_blank" REL="noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</A>. </STRONG></STRONG></P>
<P>The Cooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme supports industry-led collaborations between industry, researchers and the community. In its 27-year history, it has proven to be an effective model for linking researchers with industry to address R&D challenges with commercial outcomes.</P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>Bidding for a CRC is a highly competitive process requiring cross-disciplinary teams to come together and collaborate. This takes planning, time and patience. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><SPAN>Developed by the <STRONG>CRC Association</STRONG> and <A HREF="https://collabforge.com/" TARGET="_blank" REL="noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow"><STRONG>Collabforge</STRONG></A>, this workshop (two half-days) will combine practical</SPAN> bid-creation content with a deep dive into the theory and practice of collaboration.</P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal">The workshop will teach participants what makes a great bid, what the process of bid development entails, the roles of all bid participants, and how to build effective relationship / communication between researchers and industry to develop a compelling bid. <SPAN>Participants will be provided with the </SPAN>opportunity to develop their ideas in conjunction with guidance materials and feedback, finishing with substantive parts of their bid concepts being fleshed out (these can be hypothetical CRCs, bids planned for submission, or even ARC Linkage type concepts).</P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal">This will help researchers to better understand how they can build successful partnerships with their industry partners, and form a bid concept that will deliver industry impact.</P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal">Attending this workshop will significantly increase the likelihood of a successful CRC or CRC-P application.  </P>
<P CLASS="MsoNormal"><STRONG>Thank you to QUT for hosting. </STRONG></P>
