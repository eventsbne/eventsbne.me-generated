title: Go Blue-Green with Azure Deployment Slots
date: '2018-04-03T12:08:23.921Z'

<p>In this session Dan Dekel (Co-Founder of Patient Zero) will show you how you can achieve zero-downtime deployments using blue-green deployments with Azure Deployment Slots. The Blue-Green deployment pattern has increased in popularity over recent years thanks to Dave Farley and Jez Humble’s book “Continuous Delivery”. Benefits include zero-downtime and instant rollback which are a long sought after goal for many organisations. Deployment Slots have been available to us on Azure for several years, however not many of us have actually used them. In his talk, Dan will cover implementation strategies, potential gotcha’s and testing in production.</p> <p>About the Presenter</p> <p>Dan is a director and co-founder at Patient Zero who deploy software development teams to solve customer problems. He’s a strong believer in autonomous delivery teams. Despite being a C# developer, you’ll occasionally hear him mumble "...this would be so much easier to do in F#".</p>
