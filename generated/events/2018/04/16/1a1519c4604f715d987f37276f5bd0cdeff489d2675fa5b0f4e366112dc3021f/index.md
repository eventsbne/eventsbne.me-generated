<p>Welcome to the second event of 2018!</p> <p>As the year is rolling fast, we thought April would be awesome to look at the hot-topic of gamification and how might we incorporate this element into products.</p> <p>The amazing gamification geek ü§ì, Dr. Zac Fitz-Walter will take us through some great examples of how simple tricks can transform your products and make them fun, engaging and pleasant to use!</p> <p>Special thanks to Fishburners and Sketch for making this month's event possible üéâ</p> <p>We can't wait to see you there!</p> <p>PS: We will have some great swags and giveaways for all, don't miss out üéÅ</p>
