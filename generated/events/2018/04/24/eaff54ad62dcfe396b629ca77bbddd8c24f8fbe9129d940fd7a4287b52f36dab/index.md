<p>About our Meetup group:</p> <p>Welcome to the Elabor8 Lunch and Learn Meetup group! We're really excited to be launching and kicking off in 2017. We'll be meeting monthly on the last Tuesday of each month over lunch time.</p> <p>About the talk:</p> <p>Paraphrasing Winston Churchill, “Business [sic] is almost as exciting as war, and quite as dangerous. In war you can only be killed once, but in business [sic] many times.”<br/>We will look at the cultural, psychological and anthropological commonalities and distinctives evidenced in the five generations of warfare and other competitive environments. The focus will be on military AND non military asymmetrical conflicts where one party has significantly less resources at their disposal.<br/>We will also see how ‘agility’ has existed for thousands of years before ‘agile’ and what the unchanging principles are. Even if we can’t pronounce them we will learn about the importance of concepts like “Auftragstaktik”, “Fingerspitzengefühl” and “Behendigkeit”. We will even look at a simple decision making feedback loop that generates time competitive advantages. We won’t have time to look at its utilisation of Hegelian dialectics and Popper’s Evolutionary Epistemology but they are there!</p> <p>Short Form Synopsis<br/>How and why ‘David’s’ consistently beat ‘Goliath’s’.</p> <p>About the speaker:</p> <p>Peter Hermann owns and operates a family business focused on niche segments of the financial services sector: a David amongst Goliaths. Past iterations include education and training; managing critical incidents for a national event at the planning and pointy ends; a stint as a minister in the Presbyterian church; extensive involvement in implementing agile in NFP’s (with very mixed results). A long term student of many things, including asymmetrical conflicts in both war and business. Other activities include in depth engagement in Restorative Justice. For anyone into Meyer Briggs, Peter is an ENTP so expect to see some disparate connections and applications.</p> <p>LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterhermann101/" class="linkified">https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterhermann101/</a></p> <p>Or Google ‘IOHAI’</p> <p>About Elabor8:</p> <p>A leading provider of Innovation and Agility expertise, Elabor8 teaches companies how to be forward thinking and adaptive, by looking at what the most innovative startup companies are doing and helping to adapt these methods for the enterprise.</p> <p>Lunch provided:</p> <p>We will be providing sandwiches and wraps to enjoy while listening to the talk.</p>
