<p>Welcome back to the Brisbane's Virtual/Augmented Reality monthly event! With the latest announcements around wireless VR technology and higher resolution screens we are excited for 2018 and the advances the technology will bring.</p> <p>Our fourth meetup for the year will be hosted Free Space VR Arcade in Fortitude Valley, just a short stroll from the Netherworld Barcade and Fortitude Valley Train Station</p> <p>LOCATION: FREE SPACE VR ARCADE, 295 ST PAULS TERRACE, FORTITUDE VALLEY</p> <p>TIME: 6:00PM - 9:00PM, 24th of April</p> <p>PARKING: Free On-Street Parking in the area, suggest Warry Street and Kennigo Street</p> <p>PRESENTATION:</p> <p>Nick Wallace - Free Space VR Arcade Owner and Developer Demos</p> <p>This months meeting is a little different, we'll be having it at the Free Space VR Arcade and the Owner, Nick, will be giving a short presentation on the Arcade itself. Adoption of AR/VR hinges a lot on it becoming more easily understood and being more commonly accepted by the Public, Arcades are a great step towards giving the public greater access to the Virtual World and allowing Developers platforms to get their titles out to a portion of people whom aren't able to justify the currently high prices of a full VR Setup or simply don't have the space for it!</p> <p>We'll then be having a selection of Developers making their demos available to you all and they'll be given a few minutes each to run you through what they're doing. The aim of the evening is to get more people into the Headsets, trying things out and more time to chat with the Developers about how to improve their artwork.</p> <p>DEMOS: We will have a number of VR/AR headsets available for demonstrations on the night. If you have any recommendations on specific experiences or would like to demo something you have been working on we would be happy to accommodate you.</p>
