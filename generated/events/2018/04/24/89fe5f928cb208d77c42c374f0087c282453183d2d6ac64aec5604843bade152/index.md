<p>STATISTICAL SOCIETY OF AUSTRALIA QUEENSLAND ORDINARY BRANCH MEETING</p> <p>TIME: 4:30 pm for refreshments followed by talk at 5:00pm, Tuesday 24 April 2018</p> <p>COST: Free</p> <p>VENUE: Queensland University of Technology, Gardens Point, building B, Room 124</p> <p>Members and guests are welcome to join the speaker afterwards at a nearby restaurant.</p> <p>TITLE: The effect of late onset, short term caloric restriction on the core temperature and physical activity in mice</p> <p>SPEAKER: Professor Richard Boys, Newcastle University (UK)</p> <p>ABSTRACT:</p> <p>Caloric restriction (CR) has been shown to delay the onset of cancer and other diseases associated with ageing. Currently there are very few studies examining the whole-animal physiological response to late onset CR. In this talk I look at ways by which mice physiologically compensate for reduced food availability given exposure to late onset CR and compare these to mice fed ad libitum (AL). The data arise from a 70 day experiment undertaken by the collaborators from the Institute for Ageing and Health at Newcastle University. A joint model is developed to describe core body temperature and activity levels and the model parameters assessed for temporal dependence by using dynamic linear models (DLMs). A Bayesian approach is used throughout. The dynamic parameters are shown to be plausibly constant over time and the constant parameter model is then embedded within a random effects structure to explore differences between the responses of CR and AL mice. This model is shown to provide a good description of the data.</p> <p>BIOGRAPHY:</p> <p>Richard Boys is Professor of Applied Statistics at Newcastle University (UK) where he is Head of Pure Mathematics and Statistics. He is also an Adjunct Professor in the School of Mathematical Sciences at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) and an Associate Investigator of ACEMS. He is an applied Bayesian statistician with a wide range of interests both in methodology and applications. Professor Boys has published over 100 papers and has been awarded research grants by many UK research councils. He has been a member of the Council of the Royal Statistical Society and currently is Editor of J. Roy. Statist. Soc C.</p>
