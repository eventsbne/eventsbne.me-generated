<p>EUGENE DUBOSSARSKY: "From Quantum Computing to Quantum Machine Learning."</p> <p>About the Talk: Quantum Computing is in its infancy, but very much alive, attracting increasing attention and it is now a commercial reality. Exploiting the odd, inexplicable effects of quantum mechanics, it provides a means of accelerating certain forms of computation through a form of parallelisation that can be described as map-reduce across multiple universes. The results are unheard-of speeds for applications in fields including cryptography, optimisation and machine learning.<br/>Quantum Machine learning applications are also in their infancy, but fascinating innovations are just around the corner. In this presentation Eugene will provide an overview of Quantum Computing, its applications to Machine Learning, and implications for the data science field. Time permitting, there will also be an overview of the state of the art of the field, and available resources.</p> <p>About the Speaker: Dr. Eugene Dubossarsky is the principal founder of Data Science Sydney. He is the CEO of Presciient, providing quality data science training to hundreds in Australia and overseas over the last 5 years, and now offering courses in quantum computing. He is the Chief Data Scientist of AlphaZetta, a global analytics consultancy spanning 27 countries with over 330 consultants globally, as well as a founding partner of Advantage Data, an Australian analytics and data commercialisation consultancy. He is also the principal data science advisor to a growing number of technology start-ups covering the fields of banking, entertainment, medicine, sports and insurance.</p>
