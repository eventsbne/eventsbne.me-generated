<p>• What we'll do</p> <p>Shireen is an entrepreneur at heart and a blockchain enthusiast. She is co-founder of TravelbyBit where she oversees business development, strategy and operations. She is also an avid traveller, having found her way across America, Europe and most of Asia. Shireen has many travel highlights but rates Kitesurfing in Kalpitiya as her favourite. A mother to two toddler boys, Shireen with her passion for travel and cryptocurrency has made her an advocate of digital currency tourism, the heartbeat and vision of TravelbyBit. • What to bring</p> <p>Complimentary lunch will be provided. Please DM me if you have any dietary requirements.</p> <p>• Important to know</p> <p>Brisbane Women in Blockchain Meetup has a code of conduct. I generally put aside 30 mins from 12.00 pm to 12.30 pm for a networking lunch then from 12.30 pm to 1.30 pm for the Meetup then 1.30 pm to 2.00 pm for more networking.</p>
