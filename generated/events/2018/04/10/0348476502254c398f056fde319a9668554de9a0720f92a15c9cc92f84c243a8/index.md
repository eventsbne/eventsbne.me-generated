<p>Brisbane Full Stack User Group - session 1: Unit Tests with EF Core SQLite – presented by Jernej Kavka</p> <p>When trying to test applications functionalities, sometimes we need to verify that the data flows correctly, technically a integration test.</p> <p>While EF Core has In-Memory DB, it does not have all of functionalities required to properly test.</p> <p>We’ll dive deep into SQLite, why should you use it for unit testing and why should you avoid it.</p> <p>About the presenter:<br/>With 8 years of experience in software engineering across multiple industries like museums, government, banks, gaming, entertainment, Jernej has worked on full stack development of native applications from mobile to desktop applications.</p> <p>JK loves working on Angular and .NET Core and his most recent projects have featured Docker and AKS (Azure Kubernetes Services). He now loves containers and sees everything as a container!</p> <p>================================================================</p> <p>Brisbane Full Stack User Group - session 2: Full Stack Reactive Programming – presented by Brendan Richards</p> <p>Like many developers, Brendan first started using reactive patterns with RxJS and JavaScript-based user interfaces.</p> <p>But reactive programming is a pattern that can apply in many more places and Reactive libraries have been released for many languages – including Reactive Extensions for C#.<br/>This talk explores using Reactive Extensions on the server side under ASP.NET Core.</p> <p>About the presenter:<br/>Brendan is a solution architect at SSW who spends most of his time “at the coal face” delivering web solutions for his clients.</p> <p>When not developing, Brendan also teaches .NET Core and Angular at SSW FireBootCamp courses.<br/>Brendan’s current list of favourite things include: .NET Core, Linux, Azure, Elastic Search, Angular and ngrx.</p>
