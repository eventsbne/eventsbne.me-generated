<p>brig will be taking part in the worldwide conference on robots, (chat)bots and AI, the first time in a convenient Asia/Pacific time slot :)<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/gobottish?lang=en" class="linkified">https://twitter.com/gobottish?lang=en</a></p> <p>** PROGRAMME **<br/><a href="http://www.bottish.co/" class="linkified">http://www.bottish.co/</a></p> <p>Title: Things you didn't know about building chatbots<br/>Presenter: Ofer Ronen -- General Manager, Chatbase (at Google's Area 120)</p> <p>Chatbots are expected to make machine communication feel human. But high-quality bot experiences are very hard to build. Certain issues in particular make building bots that do not frustrate users difficult. For example, UMM (unsupported, misunderstood, or missed user messages) issues can make a bot frustrating to use. Unfortunately for bot builders and developers, traditional methods for addressing such issues can be tedious, usually requiring manually sifting through logs—just as we did with weblogs for understanding website interactions.<br/>Ofer Ronen explores the challenges in optimizing chatbots and shares ways for developers to address them quickly and efficiently.</p> <p>Title: The need for robots to grasp the world<br/>Presenter: Juxi Leitner -- Research Fellow, Australian Centre for Robotic Vision</p> <p>Robots are everywhere, at least in industry. Why are so far only very few robots in use outside of factory floors? Why are vacuum cleaning “robots” so dumb?<br/>There are multiple reasons why we do not see robots running around in daily life. In particular two things seem to be holding us back 1) perceiving and understanding the world that is happening around us 2) performing tasks in that world that involve interacting — such as picking or grasping — with objects.<br/>A quick overview of what the current challenges in robotics, vision and machine learning are and how we, as robotics researchers and specifically at the Australian Centre for Robotic Vision, are trying to overcome those.</p> <p>Title: bottish and SEED: Dream team for democratizing AI<br/>Presenter: Gaby K. Slezák, MA -- Bot Community Initiatives at SEED Vault Ltd.</p> <p>bottish has been on a mission to establish a global, truly digital, open exchange of knowledge about bots and AI. SEED sees a future where we need an alternative to the IP monopolies of a few large corporations that would like to control bot technology. The SEED Token and protocol enables an open, independent, peer-to-peer platform for conversational interfaces fronting AI technologies on the blockchain. These frontends are chat bots, voice assistants, sophisticated Skype bots and 3D avatars. Seed wants to democratise the frontend of AI, and bottish seems to be the perfect partner in a global bot and AI community to make that happen.</p> <p>Gaby and Thomas will talk about the mutual benefits of their partnership. Gaby will also show &amp; tell what SEED is envisioning and in the end you’ll have the unique opportunity to tell SEED in a quick survey what you need the most to develop, deploy or use sophisticated bots in your field.</p> <p>** IMPORTANT TO KNOW **<br/>bottish is a global online event, with speakers presenting about a wide range of topics, including robotics, chatbots and AI.<br/>Brisbane is streaming the event at the Australian Centre for Robotic Vision (ACRV), at QUT starting at 5pm.</p>
