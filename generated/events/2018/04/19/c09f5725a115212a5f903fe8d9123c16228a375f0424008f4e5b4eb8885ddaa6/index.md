<P><STRONG>Join the Global Change Institute and the Australian Meteorological &amp; Oceanographic Society (Qld) as we welcome the award-winning climate scientist and writer <A HREF="https://www.findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/display/person203094" TARGET="_blank" REL="noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow">Dr Joëlle Gergis</A> from the University of Melbourne.</STRONG></P>
<P>What was Australia’s climate like before official weather records began?</P>
<P>How do scientists use tree-rings, ice cores and tropical corals to retrace the past?</P>
<P>What do Indigenous seasonal calendars reveal? And what do settler diary entries about rainfall, droughts, bushfires and snowfalls tell us about natural climate cycles?</P>
<P>Dr Gergis's book <EM>Sunburnt Country</EM> pieces together Australia’s climate history for the first time. It uncovers a continent long vulnerable to climate extremes and variability. It gives an unparalleled perspective on how human activities have altered patterns that have been with us for millions of years, and what climate change looks like in our own backyard.</P>
<P><EM>Sunburnt Country</EM> highlights the impact of a warming planet on Australian lifestyles and ecosystems and the power we all have to shape future life on Earth.</P>
