<p>Come along and join us while we chat about IT, philosophy &amp; metaphysics.</p> <p>Please don't get turned off if there are not many attendees responding. This Meetup is here so new people can find us. Our Techies generally forget to respond :)</p> <p>We do now take a GOLD COIN DONATION JAR to the lunch - not compulsory. We do that because Meetup charge us $AU121 twice a year to keep this here.</p>
