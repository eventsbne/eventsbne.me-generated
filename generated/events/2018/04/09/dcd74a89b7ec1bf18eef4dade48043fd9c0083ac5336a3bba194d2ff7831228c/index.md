    SPARQ-ed 2-day Junior Research Immersions are aimed at providing Year 6-9
    students from all over Queensland an opportunity to explore concepts and use
    techniques not normally covered in a school science laboratory. \nThis year,
    our theme will be the use of fluorescent proteins in Cell and Molecular
    Biology. Students will express Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)\u00a0in
    bacterial or mammalian cells, purify the protein by ion-exchange
    chromatography, and analyse the protein by SDS Polyacrylamide Gel
    Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). They will also perform DNA plasmid extraction
    from bacteria by alkaline lysis, followed by analysis of the purified DNA by
    agarose gel electrophoresis. Mammalian cells expressing\u00a0GFP will also
    be examined by fluorescence microscopy.\n\nThe programs are conducted in the
    SPARQ-ed teaching laboratory, a PC2 rated facility located on the ground
    floor of the Translational Research Institute in Woolloongabba,
    Brisbane.\u00a0Each one is developed and supervised by the SPARQ-ed
    teacher-scientists in conjunction with researchers from the University of
    Queensland\u2019s Diamantina Institute.\nStudents from regional Queensland
    or schools with an ICSEA (Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage)
    rating of \u2264950 may be eligible for a scholarship.\nFor more details,
    please visit the SPARQed website at https://di.uq.edu.au/sparq-ed/middle or
    email SPARQed at sparqed@uq.edu.au\n\nFAQs\n\u00a0\nAre there ID or minimum
    age requirements to enter the event?\nSPARQed 2-day Junior Research
    Immersions are open to students in Years 6-9\n\u00a0\nWhat are my
    transport/parking options for getting to and from the event?\nThe TRI is
    located\u00a0on the Princess Alexandra Hospital campus and\u00a0is easily
    accessible by public transport (buses and trains).\u00a0Detailed information
    is available\u00a0at the SPARQed website:
    https://di.uq.edu.au/sparq-ed\n\nWhat are the dress requirements?\nThe
    SPARQed laboratory is a PC2 facility, which means students must wear
    completely closed shoes covering the feet up to the ankles. Long hair must
    also be tied back off the face and neatly secured.\n\nWill food be
    provided?\nParticipating students are required to bring their own lunch but
    will be provided with\u00a0fruit\u00a0and snacks.\n\nHow can I contact the

    information?\nYes\n\u00a0\nIs my registration fee or ticket
    transferrable?\nYes. Please contact us at sparqed@uq.edu.au if you decide to

    admittance will be provided to attendees who have not
    registered.\n\n-\u00a0Please note that you are purchasing a ticket for your
    child for a 2-day Research Immersion. We are using an external provider
    Eventbrite to collect information and process payment.
