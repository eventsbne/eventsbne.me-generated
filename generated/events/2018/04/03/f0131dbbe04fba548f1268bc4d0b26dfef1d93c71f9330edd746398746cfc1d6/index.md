<P><STRONG>We are living in an age of unparalleled global change.</STRONG></P>
<P>Urbanisation, population growth, technological innovation, globalisation and unsustainable consumption are just some of the trends driving transformations that have brought about significant change in planetary systems.   <BR>The environmental consequences of these changes are particularly daunting for Indonesia, a maritime state with a predominantly coastal population.  Economically, as one the fastest growing emerging markets in the world, and the largest in Southeast Asia, Indonesia has a rapidly developing research base.  </P>
<P>This conference will showcase the work by Indonesian researchers at The University of Queensland who are working to address both the challenges and opportunities of global change. The conference will also highlight the work being done by researchers at The University of Queensland in Indonesia, and collaborations between Indonesian scholars and researchers from schools and faculties across UQ.   </P>
<P>The conference will focus on four key areas: Health and Wellbeing; Conflict and Identity; Climate Change, Environment and Sustainability; Economic Transformation. The forum will provide a platform to explore key debates and issues, advance knowledge, and contribute to better policies to meet the challenges of global change.</P>
<P><STRONG>CLUSTERS</STRONG><BR>1. Health and wellbeing (medicine, physical and mental health)<BR>2. Conflict and identity <BR>3. Climate change, environment and sustainability <BR>4. Economic transformation <BR></P>
