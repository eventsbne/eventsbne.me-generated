<p>Feature engineering, turn feature into features</p> <p>The Presentation:</p> <p>Working as a data scientist (a.k.a. the data janitor), feature engineering is one of the tasks that I usually spend many hours on. It is true that most of the dataset that we deal with already have more than enough features for us to work on. So the question is, why do we need to generate even more feature?<br/>This session will share which role of feature engineering plays in a data project, as well as how to use call log data to develop risk profile for those without any credit score.</p> <p>Our Presenter:</p> <p>Dickson Kwong has been working as a Senior Data Scientist in Information Technology and Utilities sectors since graduating with a BSc in Computer Science from University of Washington. At his previous job, Dickson was responsible for knowledge discovery on datasets, and developing larger-scale explanatory and exploratory data solutions. Dickson's expertise lies in surfacing valuable patterns from datasets and visualizing them for impact. For that process, he relies on his skills in data wrangling, data modelling, and machine learning in R and Python. Dickson is also an instructor at General Assembly's data science program in Hong Kong.</p> <p>Our Sponsor this month:</p> <p>AARNet Pty Ltd (APL) is the not for profit company that operates Australia's Academic and Research Network (AARNet). The shareholders are 38 Australian universities and the CSIRO.</p> <p>AARNet provides high capacity Internet and other communications services for the nation's research and education community, including universities, health and other research organisations, schools, vocational training providers and cultural institutions. AARNet serves over one million end users who access the network for teaching, learning and research.</p> <p>For further information, please visit: www.aarnet.edu.au (<a href="http://www.aarnet.edu.au/" class="linkified">http://www.aarnet.edu.au/</a>)</p> <p>Location and Time:</p> <p>Our event space is sponsored by Fishburners. Fishburners is Australiaâ€™s largest community of tech startups and a not for profit organisation. They support over 300 startups in their communities in Brisbane and Sydney and host more than 500 events around Australia. They offer a free one week trial which you can take up here: www.fishburners.org (<a href="http://www.fishburners.org/" class="linkified">http://www.fishburners.org/</a>)</p> <p>The event is at Fishburners, Level 2, 155 Queen Street, with official kick-off at 6:00 pm.</p>
