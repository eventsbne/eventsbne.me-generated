<p>This meetup we'll be taking a bit of a tech focus by examining some tools that are out there for automated transcriptions and road testing them (and seeing how they handle the Australian accent).</p> <p>Specifically we'll be looking at AWS' Transcription Service and comparing that against some other services out there.</p> <p>As per the February Meetup, we'll be presenting our accessibility topic from 5.30 - 6.30 in the ABC foyer, then heading over the road to James Squire to do more of the same, in a less powerpoint-y way. Morgan Strong will host this particular session, but we welcome anyone who has anything to share to bring their insights and knowledge to the forum.</p> <p>Hope you can make it!</p>
