<p>The Divorce Diary: A Modern Business Woman's Survival Guilde for Separation and Divorce.</p> <p><br/>Life is funny what it can throw at you and even funnier with its timing.</p> <p><br/>About 4 years ago I started on a transformational journey I didn't know I was about to take, but I knew it needed to take it.</p> <p><br/>It started with my new business and then a divorce, and was the perfect recipe for a life disaster ... a startup emotional woman who had just left her husband. This is the book I had to write and is my story, one I know many people going through the same things will find solace and comfort in because business and divorce can be extremely frightening and lonely. It is the self-help book I couldn't find when it comes to being in business and going through one of the most traumatic times of my life (divorce is one of the 5 most stressful things you can go through in your lifetime).</p> <p><br/>Throughout the book are my diary entries and the methods I used to not only survive my first and second year of business but smash it and while also working on myself to come out the other end relatively unscathed.</p> <p><br/>My life changed in ways I could never imagine and in one way, shape or form, you have helped mould it.</p> <p><br/>I would love to invite you to my book launch happening on April 5 in Brisbane (destination TBC).</p> <p><br/>The theme of the night is leading an amazing life and having meaningful relationships in all areas of life!</p> <p><br/>Tickets are $20 and include a drink on arrival, food, guest speaker and networking opportunities - and a magical surprise! Signed books will be available on the night.</p> <p><br/>Come and join us! Tickets at: <a href="https://www.stickytickets.com.au/64177" class="linkified">https://www.stickytickets.com.au/64177</a></p> <p><br/>See you there!</p> <p><br/>Liz</p>
