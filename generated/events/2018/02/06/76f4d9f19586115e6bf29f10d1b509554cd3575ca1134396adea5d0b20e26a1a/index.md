title: World Retrospective Day - Lean Coffee
date: null

---
<p>Hi all,</p> <p>It's world retrospective day on Tuesday 6th February. Check out - <a href="http://worldretroday.com/" class="linkified">http://worldretroday.com/</a></p> <p>For this auspicious day we are going to move our February Lean Coffee to Tuesday 6th and have a special Retrospective theme.</p> <p>------------------------------</p> <p>What is Lean Coffee?</p> <p>Lean Coffee is a structured, but agenda-less meeting. Participants gather, build an agenda, and begin talking. Conversations are directed and productive because the agenda for the meeting was democratically generated. More info via: <a href="http://leancoffee.org/" class="linkified">http://leancoffee.org/</a></p> <p>What do I need to bring?</p> <p>Yourself :-) Post-it notes and pens will be provided. Elabor8 (<a href="https://elabor8.com.au/" class="linkified">https://elabor8.com.au/</a>) provides coffees and hot chocolates for all.</p>
