Also, guidance will be provided to help you choose the appropriate mode for your project.</p> <p>In this presentation, you will learn:<br/>• How to develop a Live Connection report<br/>• How to develop a Direct Query model<br/>• How to develop an import model<br/>• How to determine the appropriate Power BI Desktop mode for your project</p> <p><b>THE SPEAKER</b><br/>Peter Myers is a consultant, trainer and presenter from Melbourne.
