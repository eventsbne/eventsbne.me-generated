<H3>A UNIQUE NIGHT OF GLOBAL CHANGE SOLUTIONS</H3>
<P>In his latest book ,<EM> Drawdown</EM>, <A HREF="http://www.paulhawken.com/" TARGET="_blank" REL="noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow">Paul Hawken</A> maps, measures, models and describes the <STRONG>100 most substantive solutions </STRONG>to global warming. For each solution, the book describes its history, the carbon impact it provides, the relevant cost and savings, the path to adoption, and how it works.</P>
<P>The goal of the research underpinning <EM>Drawdown</EM> is to determine whether we can reverse the harmful build-up of carbon in the atmosphere within thirty years. <STRONG>All</STRONG><A HREF="http://www.drawdown.org/solutions" TARGET="_blank" REL="noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow"> <STRONG>solutions</STRONG></A><STRONG> modelled are already in place, well understood, analysed based on peer-reviewed science, and are expanding around the world</STRONG>.</P>
<P>In April 2017, <EM>Drawdown</EM> hit No.9 on the New York Times bestseller list in its first week, stayed on the list for four weeks, and is now in its fifth printing. It was the first book on the environment or climate to attain this ranking in more than 25 years. <EM>Drawdown</EM> is Hawken’s fifth NYT bestseller.</P>
<P><EM>Project Drawdown</EM> is facilitating a broad coalition of researchers, scientists, graduate students, PhDs, post-docs, policy makers, business leaders and activists to assemble and present the best available information on climate solutions in order to describe their beneficial financial, social and environmental impact over the next 30 years.</P>
<H3>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</H3>
<P><STRONG>Paul Hawken</STRONG> is an author and activist. He has founded successful, ecologically-conscious businesses, and consulted with heads of state and CEOs on economic development, industrial ecology, and environmental policy.</P>
<P>He has written seven books including four national bestsellers: <EM>The Next Economy, Growing a Business</EM>, and <EM>The Ecology of Commerce</EM>, and <EM>Blessed Unrest. The Ecology of Commerce</EM> was voted as the No.1 college text on business and the environment by professors in 67 business schools. <EM>Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution</EM>, co-authored with Amory Lovins, has been referred to by several heads of state including President Bill Clinton who called it one of the most important books in the world at that time. He has served on the board of many environmental organisations including Center for Plant Conservation, Shelburne Farms, Trust for Public Land, Conservation International, and National Audubon Society<STRONG>.</STRONG></P>
<P>The objective of the solutions list is to be inclusive, presenting an extensive array of impactful measures already in existence. The list is comprised primarily of “no regrets” solutions—actions that make sense to take regardless of their climate impact since they have intrinsic benefits to communities and economies. These initiatives improve lives, create jobs, restore the environment, enhance security, generate resilience, and advance human health.</P>
<P>In <EM>Drawdown</EM>, each solution is measured and modelled to determine its carbon impact through to 2050, the total and net cost to society, and the total lifetime savings (or cost). The exception to this are the "Coming Attraction" solutions, which are a window into what is still emerging. For these solutions, Hawken did not measure cost, savings, or atmospheric impact, but he illuminates technologies and concepts whose growth the world will continue to watch.</P>
<HR>
<P>After the presentation, Paul Hawken will be joined by GCI's Prof. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg on stage for a 20-minute Q&A session with audience members. As places are limited for this unique event, please only reserve seats if you  are sure you can attend. Limit of two seats per registration.<BR></P>
