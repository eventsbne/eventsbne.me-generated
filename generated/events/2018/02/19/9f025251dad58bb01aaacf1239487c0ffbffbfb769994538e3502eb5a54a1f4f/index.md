<p>• What we'll do<br/>Come and listen to some quality speakers, network with other frontend devs, and chat about all the cool things going on in the React ecosystem.</p> <p>As always, the meetup is great for both newbies &amp; veterans alike. There's free beers &amp; pizza provided. Talks start at 6:30. Feel free to arrive any time after 6:00.</p> <p>-- AGENDA</p> <p>* Talk 1 - TBD (30 mins)</p> <p>* Talk 2 - TBD (30 mins)</p> <p>-- SPONSORS</p> <p>Pizza sponsored by Just Digital People.</p> <p>Beers and venue sponsored by Rex Software.</p> <p>-- BECOME A SPEAKER</p> <p>Want to give a talk? Let us know via Meetup messenger or post a Github issue:<br/><a href="https://github.com/Brisbane-React-JS/meetups/issues" class="linkified">https://github.com/Brisbane-React-JS/meetups/issues</a></p> <p>All our speakers are now rewarded with a React T-shirt thanks to Glen from FunCaptcha :)</p> <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>Street parking can be pretty tricky, so it would be a good idea to allow extra time if driving. There is 2 hour free parking nearby at Gasworks.</p> <p>If you choose public transport, the venue is close to the Teneriffe Ferry Terminal and buses. Front door will be open for the event.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Nothing (though a laptop can be useful)</p>
