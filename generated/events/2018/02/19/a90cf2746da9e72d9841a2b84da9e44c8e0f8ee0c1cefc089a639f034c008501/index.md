<p>You're invited to join Epic Games for Getting Started with Unreal Engine, a live training tutorial where participants will learn the basics of creating their first project in Unreal Engine.</p> <p>This introductory tutorial assumes participants have basic 3D game development understanding, but no prior experience with UE4. You will learn the basics of creating a game from starter content using the UE4 Blueprint visual scripting system. Blueprints are easily leveraged by all game development disciplines, so artists, designers, and programmers are welcome.</p> <p>Topics we'll cover include: project setup, controller setup, basics of VR, importing assets, building materials, creating character classes, creating AI, navigation, blending animation, spawning enemies, maintaining game state, and configuring in-game UI. We will also cover design principles, blueprint debugging and performance optimization techniques.</p> <p>Schedule:</p> <p>6:30 PM – Lecture begins<br/>8:00 PM – Break<br/>8:15 PM – Lecture continues<br/>9:30 PM – Lecture concludes</p> <p>COMPULSORY: Spaces are limited, so be sure to sign up to the Eventbrite page, here:<br/><a href="https://getting-started-unreal-brisbane.eventbrite.com/" class="linkified">https://getting-started-unreal-brisbane.eventbrite.com/</a></p>
