<p>About our Meetup group:</p> <p>Welcome to the Elabor8 Lunch and Learn Meetup group! We're really excited to be launching and kicking off in 2017. We'll be meeting monthly on the last Tuesday of each month over lunch time.</p> <p>About the talk:</p> <p>The inspiration for this was a challenge I set for myself this year to identify areas in my life where I was unskilled and unaware of it, or experiencing the Dunning Kruger Effect. It was harder than I thought at first, and it started a learning journey through skill acquisition models that culminated in creating trainings around the subject. I now want to bring what I learned and created to a wider audience. In this talk, we will learn how lemon juice doesn't make you invisible to bank security cameras among other useful pieces of information such as: How do you know when you're unskilled and unaware of it? How can you push yourself and/or your team to start holistic and sustainable skill growth?</p> <p>Focussing on the Dunning Kruger effect and the Dreyfus Model for Skill Acquisition, we will learn how to spot this in ourselves and our teams and then use it in our continuous improvement.</p> <p>About the speaker:</p> <p>Will McNelis is an Agile and Lean professional with more than 20 years of diverse expertise in the areas of coaching, project and program management, business management, communications, marketing, user experience, web design and development, e-Commerce, and digital strategy. I have worked across sectors such as finance, FMCG, travel and leisure, consulting, and real estate.</p> <p>I have been at Tatts Group for two years now, coaching agile teams in areas such as Infrastructure, Operations and Support, Marketing, and Software Delivery. From a technical side, I have enjoyed learning about Infrastructure as Code, Continuous Integration and Delivery, and Performance Marketing. From a process side, I have been enjoying continued learning in the agile and Lean space as well as speaking at several conferences such as Agile 2017 and LAST Conference.</p> <p>About Elabor8:</p> <p>A leading provider of Innovation and Agility expertise, Elabor8 teaches companies how to be forward thinking and adaptive, by looking at what the most innovative startup companies are doing and helping to adapt these methods for the enterprise.</p> <p>Lunch provided:</p> <p>We will be providing sandwiches and wraps to enjoy while listening to the talk.</p>
