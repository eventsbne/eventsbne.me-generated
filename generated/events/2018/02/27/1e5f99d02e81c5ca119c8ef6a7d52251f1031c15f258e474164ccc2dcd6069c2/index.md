<p>Join us on the 27th for our first meetup for 2018. We'll have drinks and pizza, the usual news roundup and a talk on Visual Studio App Center. App Center recently came out of preview and aims to be your one stop shop for mobile application lifecycle management. We'll give it a rundown and some demos during the session so you can see how it can make your app development life easier. Look forward to seeing you there!</p>
