<p>** NOTE: The starting time is 5:30 pm, Brisbane time.</p> <p>Schedule:</p> <p>* Presentation: Making Imposter Syndrome work for you : 5:45 - 6:15-ish<br/>* Hands-on Activity: Writing Docs for Blocks : 6:15-ish - 6:45<br/>* Snacks and chat: 6:45 - 7:30<br/>----------</p> <p>PRESENTATION</p> <p>Making Imposter Syndrome work for you</p> <p>Nicola Nye, Customer and Communications Manager, FastMail<br/>(Presented by Russell Dickenson, Red Hat)</p> <p>Summary</p> <p>A soul searching examination on what it means to be a documentarian, why most of us think we're frauds, and why this is actually totally completely utterly great! All through the lens of Mem Fox's classic: "Where is the Green Sheep?"</p> <p>About the presenter</p> <p>Nicola Nye has kindly agreed to let me present "Making Imposter Syndrome work for you", which she gave at the WTD Melbourne meetup on 8 February. All credit for the presentation goes to her. I will be merely channeling her, minus the coloured hair. Technically, I guess *all* hair is coloured, but that's beside the point.</p> <p>Russell is a Senior Technical (*) Writer at Red Hat Asia Pacific. He has been a technical writer for 6 years, prior to that a SysAdmin for a little over 20 years, and prior to that his memory gets a little fuzzy. He is eager to learn from everyone around him, and an avocado for free and open source software.</p> <p>* Aged over 50, but "Senior" is also part of his official Red Hat title.</p> <p>----------</p> <p>ACTIVITY</p> <p>Writing Docs for Blocks</p> <p>Details of this activity must remain secret, but it will involve paper, pens, pencils, and Lego pieces.</p> <p><br/>----------</p> <p>BONUS PRESENTATION (During post-meetup snacks)</p> <p>If the attendees are interested, there will be a demonstration of an Atom linter used by Red Hat technical writers which detects usage of words and phrases which do not comply with the Red Hat Word Usage Guide.</p>
