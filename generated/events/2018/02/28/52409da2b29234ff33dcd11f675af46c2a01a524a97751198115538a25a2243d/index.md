<p>Happy Wednesday folks!</p> <p>We have a fantastic workshop coming up for you this month! Read below for more info.</p> <p>Talk will kick off at 6.30pm. As always, pizza &amp; drinks provided by ThoughtWorks. See you there :)</p> <p>---</p> <p>Title: A tasting plate of nifty things from the land of functional programming.</p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p>There are plenty of talks that introduce the basics of functional programming, and there are quite a few talks that try to explain some complex conceptual or theoretical piece of the puzzle.<br/>This is not either of those talks. Instead, we'll be taking a series of shallow dives into a handful of libraries and tools in the functional programming space that are particular good at getting people excited.</p> <p>The main theme will be showing off the nice things you can unearth if you have a community of motivated and curious folks from a lot of different domains and have them dig in a lot of different directions.<br/>We'll run the gamut from interesting takes on data structures and algorithms, to some new kinds of abstraction, to libraries and tools for DSLs, parsing, concurrency, rest APIS, front end work, testing, benchmarking and deployment.</p> <p>Bio:</p> <p>Dave Laing is a senior functional programming engineer at the Queensland<br/>Functional Programming Lab. He writes functional code, he blogs about<br/>functional topics, and he talks about functional programming whenever he<br/>gets the chance.</p>
