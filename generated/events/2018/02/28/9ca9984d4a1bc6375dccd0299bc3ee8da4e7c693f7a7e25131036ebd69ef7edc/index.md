<p>Join us on 28 February to experience the Playing Lean game!</p> <p>• Play the Game!</p> <p>• Help your team understand Lean Startup in 2 hours</p> <p>• Each game is limited to a maximum of 12-16 players</p> <p>Playing Lean (<a href="http://www.playinglean.com/)is" class="linkified">http://www.playinglean.com/)is</a> an educational board game which facilitates learning of the Lean Start-up principles through gamified experience.</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WNUO08rpqY" class="embedded">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WNUO08rpqY</a></p> <p>In August this year we welcomed the expertise of Bruno Pešec (<a href="https://no.linkedin.com/in/bpesec" class="linkified">https://no.linkedin.com/in/bpesec</a>), Lean Practitioner and Playing Lean Facilitator, from Norway to share his experience with the game. For those who met Bruno and played the introduction, this will be the opportunity to play the full game!</p> <p>Playing Lean is closely aligned with Ash Maurya's Running Lean, (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Running-Lean-Iterate-Works-OReilly/dp/1449305172)and" class="linkified">https://www.amazon.com/Running-Lean-Iterate-Works-OReilly/dp/1449305172)and</a> was involved with the development of the game. Ash endorses it as an educational tool for the Lean Start-up.</p> <p>Who is Playing Lean for?</p> <p>For Startup founders who would like to learn from experienced trainers about Lean Startup methodology and how to apply it to mitigate the risk of failure and build products people want.</p> <p>For Intrapreneurs, individuals who work independently within a company in order to introduce innovation and to revitalize and diversify its business.</p> <p>For Professionals working on innovative ideas or developing their projects, who want to learn about Lean Startup methodology, and how to use it to boost their odds of success.</p> <p>Playing Lean – A Learning Tool</p> <p>Playing Lean is both a serious board game and a great workshop format. Combined, it's a great way to kickstart your learning about Lean Startup. You get to play a game, have a lot of fun and still call it work!</p> <p>Game Mechanisms</p> <p>The game is won by the team who use their resources best. Throughout the game, you have to do your research on potential customers, develop a product by building and removing properties, and sell the product to ever larger customer groups. The winner is the first team to sell their product to the mass market. Players feel the pressure of inadequate resources, unexpected experiment results, and how small margins can be the difference between winning the mass market and losing it to a competitor.</p> <p>Playing Lean is rapidly growing around the world with the following Governments and Institutions adopting the game to teach Lean Startup:</p> <p>• Startup Labs Oslo</p> <p>• Swiss Startup Factory</p> <p>• Innovation Lab Fribourg</p> <p>• Swiss Startup Association</p> <p>• Norwegian University of Life Sciences</p> <p>• Berlin University of the Arts</p> <p>There are certified Playing Lean facilitators in: Belgium, Croatia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Norway, Russia, Switzerland, The Netherlands, The United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom.</p> <p>Sponsorship</p> <p>We greatly appreciate the support of Jason Lowe and Oracle Brisbane Meetup for hosting this event.</p>
