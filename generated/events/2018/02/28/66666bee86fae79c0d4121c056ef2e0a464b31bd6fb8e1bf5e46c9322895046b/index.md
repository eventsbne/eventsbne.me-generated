<p>• What we'll do<br/>We'll have a couple of talks, get some volunteers for more content, have some drinks and Pizza's etc.</p> <p>Talks start at 6:30. Feel free to arrive any time after 6:00.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Yourselves!</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>Street parking can be pretty tricky, so it would be a good idea to allow extra time if driving. There is 2 hour free parking nearby at Gasworks.</p> <p>If you choose public transport, the venue is close to the Teneriffe Ferry Terminal and buses. Front door will be open for the event.</p>
