<p>The lovely people from Jumbo reminded me that at the last meetup, they offered to host. So here we are.</p> <p>As always we need speakers so if you have something you would like to show off, hit me up and I'll add you to the speaker list!</p> <p>As an added bonus, this meetup is listed as a Go 1.10 Release Party <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-1.10-Release-Party" class="linkified">https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-1.10-Release-Party</a></p> <p>Speakers</p> <p>Taylor Lawson, Jumbo Interactive : "Boil 'em, mash 'em, test 'em in a stew"</p>
