Duncan will be covering off real-world operational experiences relating to their environment / implementation and how they deal with keeping up to date with an ever evolving landscape.</p> <p>Duncan will chat about -</p> <p>* The importance of keeping up to date on major releases</p> <p>* How new firmware cycles lead to increased functionality with legacy equipment</p> <p>* How Griffith have benefited from this capability over the last 3 years.</p> <p>Duncan will also cover off -</p> <p>* Griffith futures/challenges that are here and upcoming.</p> <p>* Cloud landscape and the expectations from Cloud infrastructure</p> <p>* Purchasing models - And potential challenges encountered along the way</p> <p>We'll also cover off all things new from NetApp with the DataFabric and HCI.</p> <p>But mostly importantly come and chat with your peers our "NetApp Ninjas!" and see how they are solving their challenges and what they have learnt along the way.</p> <p>Please come with an open mind and be prepared to share.</p> <p>Only rule - No Sales Guys :)</p>
