<p>• What we'll do</p> <p>At our monthly evening events we begin with networking and a light dinner (finger foods, beer, wine and soft drinks), then presentations commence from 6:30.</p> <p>This month we'll have a number of short presentations from startups that focus on IoT in safety and related techologies.</p> <p>What would you like to learn about? Let us know!<br/>Is there something you would like to share? We can offer you encouragement and guidance to present to the group.</p> <p>• Important to know</p> <p>Please note this event is at UQ StLucia campus. (iLab also has a facility in neighbouring Long Pocket, it's NOT that one!)</p>
