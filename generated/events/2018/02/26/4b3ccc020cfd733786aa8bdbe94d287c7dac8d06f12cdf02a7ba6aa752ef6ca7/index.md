title: Discrimination in the recruitment process (Software Testing)
date: '2018-02-18T11:14:43.477Z'

---
<p>Everyone knows a story of discrimination in the recruitment process. And while it is largely unacceptable it is still something that many people must face on a regular basis. This presentation is about understanding discrimination in the recruitment process in our industry; who’s coping it, who’s dishing it out, what’s acceptable, what’s not acceptable, and what can we do about it. The focus is on solutions and arming individuals with strategies necessary to avoid being discriminated against, allowing for a fair recruitment process. This presentation is suitable for anyone who engages regularly with recruiters (agency and internal recruiters), or anyone who is unsure about what to do in the case of discrimination in the recruitment process.</p> <p>About the presenter: Kate Smith is a professional Human Resources specialist with over 7 years specialising in the field of software testing and quality assurance, and over 11 years in Information Technology. She has dedicated her career to helping software testing professionals achieve the roles that they want through effective approaches to the recruitment process. Kate is ISTQB certified and holds supporting qualifications in Human Resources and Business Management. Kate owns her own HR firm (Shift Left Consulting) which aims to help software testing job seekers enter and move around the local job market, but is also a Resourcing and Engagement Manager at Revolution IT, Brisbane.</p> <p>Arrive anytime after 5.30pm for a 6pm start. Pizzas will be available on the night and are provided by ThoughtWorks.</p> <p>In case you arrive after 6pm and are not able to go up the elevator, please call ThoughtWorks on 3129 4506.</p>
