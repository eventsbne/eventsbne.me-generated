<P CLASS="MsoNormal">Northern Australia is a highly productive part of the country with substantial opportunities for further targeted development. This region makes a substantial contribution to the Australian economy, particularly through the agriculture, mining and tourism industries. <BR>The region is also characterised by pristine environments, including the World Heritage listed Great Barrier Reef, and provides a gateway to broader markets and opportunities in Asia. <BR><BR>Key priorities for this region include the development of this northern trade gateway, a diversified economy which supports Indigenous entrepreneurs and business, world-class infrastructure, and world leading research and innovation. But realizing this future requires strategies that will improve collaboration between multiple stakeholders, and effective methods for using these multi-stakeholder perspectives to co-create solutions to complex regional challenges.</P>
<P>Professor Alan Irwin of the Copenhagen Business School is currently visiting Australia to present a series of workshops and lectures on multi stakeholder perspectives for transformational innovation. Professor Irwin is a world leading expert in the fields of science and technology policy, scientific governance, environmental sociology, and science-public relations to bear upon best practice for developing and shaping multi-stakeholder perspectives on transformative innovation.</P>
<P>In this seminar, Professor Irwin will discuss the challenges and complexity of managing our northern Australian resources and how integrated transdisciplinary and multi-stakeholder approaches will play a role in bringing about transformative innovation. <BR><BR>Please join us at this special event and stay for light refreshments post seminar to continue the discussion.<BR></P>
