title: Let's meetup and learn about Wordpress (including DIVI)
date: '1516535300752.0'

---
<p>Whilst this Wordpress group is targeted at beginners, we know we are going to get people with varying degrees of knowledge. And in order to learn Wordpress, we need to know a little bit about other things such as hosting, domain registration, what Wordpress actually is and isn't, why might we select Wordpress to build a website, and so on. Things about Wordpress beginners might like know how to do include:</p> <p>* Should I install my own version or use a hosted version?<br/>* What are themes?<br/>* What are plugins?<br/>* How do I install plugins?<br/>* Is there a cost to use Wordpress?<br/>* What security measures might be considered?<br/>* How can I build an online shop in it?<br/>* How do I make changes to pages?<br/>* How do I run a blog in Wordpress?<br/>* And so on.</p> <p>We have also merged our DIVI meetup into this group as well. DIVI is a theme and page builder framework. For those interested in using Wordpress a lot, it can make setting them up and maintaining them much easier.</p> <p>Your booking fee also includes basic food and drinks.</p>
