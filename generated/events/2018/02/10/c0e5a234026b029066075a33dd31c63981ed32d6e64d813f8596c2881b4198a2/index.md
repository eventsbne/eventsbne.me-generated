<p>• What we'll do<br/>Assemble your own 3D printer from a commercial kit. It's not hard, some screwing, and plugging, and zip-tying. Experts will be on hand to guide you.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Bring a laptop computer, and an inquiring mind. Kids are very welcome.</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>There will be a cost for this event that covers equipment and catering.
