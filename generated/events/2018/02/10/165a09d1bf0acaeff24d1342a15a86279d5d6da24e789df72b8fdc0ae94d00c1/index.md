<p>This is one of our regular fortnightly meetings. We meet to discuss and help with computer problems to do with Unix like operating systems (bsd, linux, darwin etc).</p> <p>We head off for dinner at the St Lucia Village around six thirty, the common destination is the Curry Connection.</p> <p>This meeting we have a group talk starting at 5pm, a debrief of the recent linux.conf.au conference down in Sydney. Anyone who went to the conference, or has watched any of the recordings, are encouraged to give a brief (two/three sentence) overview of talks, such that other members can be informed about what talks to catch up on.</p>
