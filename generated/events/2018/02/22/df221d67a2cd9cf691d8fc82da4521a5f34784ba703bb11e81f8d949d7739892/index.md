<p>ROOM : Meeting Room G1 6:30 In spite of the current stomach turning free fall in prices :) and it's effect on the short term profitability of ICOs, I think it's a great time to learn more for whenever the next bull trend starts (I fully believe it will happen) . So in that spirit I have a meeting room in the Southport Community Center, it will be Beginner friendly and we can go over some topics such as : &amp;gt; How to participate (white listing, getting ETH ready, following whats happening and sending in your ETH)<br/>&amp;gt; Storing / viewing tokens (My Ether Wallet)<br/>&amp;gt; Trading tokens afterwards (and a quick overview of EtherDelta.com which is usually the first exchange but tough to use)<br/>&amp;gt;Scams/red flags to watch out for.<br/>&amp;gt; Current environment and how it will affect the ICO market.<br/>&amp;gt;General chat about current state of things if there is time.<br/>..... And more</p> <p>I will also pick out 1 or 2 upcoming ICOs and we can have a look at them, and maybe an interesting past ICO or 2 and see how it's doing. I will let you know once I pick 1 or 2 and let you know prior so you can have a look at beforehand if you wish. I wouldn't expect any super hot tips at the moment that will 'go to the moon', but if you spend time learning and studying you may be able find some for yourself when the market settles again.</p> <p>UPDATE : Will go over this upcoming ICO (date not set) , because it looks like a good one, date is not set yet, and a good chance anyone wanting to get involved may be able to (but have to have your eyes open and ready) . neonexchange.org - a decentralized exchange initially running on the NEO platform.</p> <p>If anyone wants to talk about anything or has a particular ICO that they want to discuss, please let me know.</p> <p>Need to cap at 20 people for this one, will see how we go and I will go for a larger space next time if needed. PRICE : To cover the room cost, I will ask everyone attending if they could please give $5 either in cash, paypal to [masked] or send in LTC to LehKWywr8goBPQMGBVoRSaNy15GakmcHsR</p> <p>• What to bring</p> <p>• Important to know</p>
