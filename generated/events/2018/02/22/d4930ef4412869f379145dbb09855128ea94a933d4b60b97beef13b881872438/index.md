<p>â€¢ What we'll do<br/>It's a new year, time for another meetup! If you're new to elixir, are an old hand, or just curious in learning more functional programming concepts come along and say hi.</p> <p>For the first talks of the year we'll kick it off with<br/>* Aaron Abrook will start with It's just a function/functions, functions everywhere! An intro into functional development in the Elixir space and why they not nearly as scary as a lot of tutorials have lead people to believe<br/>* Matt Furness will give us a walk through on how to setup and use the Elixir Debugger with VS Code. Fewer IO.inspects and more step through debugging sounds great!<br/>* Michael Buhot, our most regular presenter, will be discussing how to make a swagger spec for your Phoenix API. As usual drinks and pizza will be provided by our sponsor.</p>
