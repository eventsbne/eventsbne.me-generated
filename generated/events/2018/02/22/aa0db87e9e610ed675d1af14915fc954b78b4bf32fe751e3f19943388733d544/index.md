<P>Full title: We punch nature and it will punch us back: the feedbacks of climate change on people</P>
<P><STRONG>Human impacts on biodiversity are leading to extinction that largely exceeds natural background rates.</STRONG></P>
<P>This is impairing the capacity of ecosystems to deliver basic goods and services to humanity; and in turn, it is undermining efforts to improve human welfare.</P>
<P>In this presentation, I describe global scale analyses into the impacts of climate change on marine and terrestrial ecosystems and how they are making a large fraction of the world’s human population vulnerable to loosing important sources of revenue, food and jobs.</P>
