But later this year, with the release of WordPress 5, the humble editor is getting a facelift. So what does that mean for you? And what if you’re already using a page builder? We’ll walk you through the basics of the new Gutenberg editor and cover what you need to know.</p> <p>2) Automate &amp; Celebrate!</p> <p>Tired of doing tasks within your WordPress website, and then having to do them again somewhere else? We'll show you how to set up an automation tool within your website to sync common actions and tasks with your favourite apps, speeding up your workflow and saving you time.</p> <p>3) The Top 3 Marketing Tools You Cant Do Without</p> <p>Before setting off on any marketing campaign, first you have to know what you are setting out to achieve and secondly how to measure success - the truth is in the numbers. Discover the 3 tools that every marketer must have and how to easily integrate them into your WordPress website.</p> <p>----------</p> <p>6.00 - Doors Open, Pre-Meetup Networking</p> <p>6.30 - Presentations Start</p> <p>Then wrapping up with some general Q&amp;As.</p> <p>----------</p> <p>The WordPress Brisbane group is run by a group of volunteers and relies upon the donations our sponsors make to the group for it to happen.</p> <p>If you'd be interested in helping us run the group in any form, sponsoring some of the costs of the meetup, or presenting on a topic you're passionate about, please get in touch - we'd love to hear from you!.</p> <p>If you'd like to organise another WordPress-related event/meetup in Brisbane (and surrounds) for the group, get in touch so we can set it up!</p>
