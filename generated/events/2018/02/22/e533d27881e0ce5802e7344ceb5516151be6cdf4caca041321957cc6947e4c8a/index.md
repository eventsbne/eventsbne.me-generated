<p>DataOps....what is it? We're exploring the intersection between DevOps and Data Science. We all have a bunch of data under the hood, yet who knows about data pipelines? Should data be treated just like any other code? How do I even baseline a Devops transformation project when there are several tools in my CI/CD pipeline?</p> <p>These and other mysterious questions will be discussed as we try to bring both sides closer to each other!</p> <p>Our first talk is by a very high calibre speaker / pin the ears back and listen sorta chap. Not only did he run a team of hundreds whilst helping to lead IT for SKY (<a href="https://www.sky.com/" class="linkified">https://www.sky.com/</a>) in the UK, he was also a Senior Consultant for Thoughtworks (<a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/" class="linkified">https://www.thoughtworks.com/</a>) here in Sydney before talking over the helm as CTO for a very large media company. It will not surprise you that Andy's extremely proficient at all things DevOps as well!</p> <p>**VIA LIVE VIDEO CONFERENCE from SYDNEY**<br/>** 5pm Brisbane, 6pm Sydney **</p> <p>Speaker 1: Andy McQuarrie<br/>Topic: Cloud Native Data Science<br/>Data Science (or big data as it's called by some) is now no longer just possible for large organisations with the ability to build large clustered environments. Any organisation can now access the best data science tools and build a data science capability.</p> <p>Speaker 2: Andy Huang<br/>Topic: Challenges in Production Machine Learning Systems<br/>In this talk, Andy will be sharing some of the key challenges in production machine learning systems and how data management plays an important part in such challenge.</p> <p>To meet the venue's Security requirements, registration via EventBrite only. Please get your ticket here: <a href="http://bit.ly/2Hsj30S" class="linkified">http://bit.ly/2Hsj30S</a></p> <p>See you all on Feb 22!</p> <p>The MeetupMadness/DataOps Team</p>
