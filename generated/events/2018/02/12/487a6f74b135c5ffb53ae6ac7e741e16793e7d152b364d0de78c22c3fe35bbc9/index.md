<p>Do you want to learn how to code and develop web applications for Ruby on Rails and have no idea where to start? Or, are you a company that has staff that need to get up to speed on Ruby on Rails?</p> <p>You are invited to attend the Ruby on Rails InstallFest, an initiative by reinteractive (<a href="http://www.reinteractive.com/" class="linkified">http://www.reinteractive.com/</a>).</p> <p>What is it about?</p> <p>This will be your opportunity to get your laptop or computer working with a full Ruby on Rails development environment, all setup and working. Most importantly, it's a FREE service!</p> <p>We get your laptop up and running on Rails. This can take a bit of work. You are welcome to bring your Windows, Mac or Linux PC, our team can help get you running on any of these.</p> <p>Once you have installed Rails, we get you building your own blog powered by Ruby on Rails, by the end of the night, you should have this up and running, online and published on the Internet.</p> <p>Then, we'll get your published blog personalised, with Javascript, CSS and headers and footers. All the while learning more about Rails.</p> <p>Wait, what do I bring?</p> <p>The only requirement is you bring your computer along with whatever power charger you need, and also, please, make sure your computer works :) Power boards will be provided, everything else is up to you.</p> <p>OK, I need one more incentive. How about free food?</p> <p>Yes, reinteractive (<a href="http://www.reinteractive.com/" class="linkified">http://www.reinteractive.com/</a>) will be providing pizza and drinks for you to enjoy while you are getting your system up and running.</p> <p>I'm a professional Rails Developer, can I help mentor?</p> <p>Yes, we are always looking for experts to come along and help :-) Just send us an email ([masked]) or RSVP to let us know you'd like to come along.</p>
