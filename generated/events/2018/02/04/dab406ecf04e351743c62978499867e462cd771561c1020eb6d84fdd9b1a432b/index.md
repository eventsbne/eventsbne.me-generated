<p>Hackerspace Ipswich is proud to announce the second offering of our Introduction to Markdown &amp; GIT workshop. Registrations essential via Eventbrite: <a href="http://bit.ly/2F5QhC4" class="linkified">http://bit.ly/2F5QhC4</a></p> <p>Participants will undertake practical learning in document production with Markdown, a light-weight documentation language, break for an hour, then continue with hands-on tutorials of GIT, a repository to control versions of their documentation, software, firmware and/or digital creations</p> <p>Many open source projects depend on version control systems, and high-quality documentation to maintain open communications with their users and the rest of the community on the progress, usage, and other information relating to their project, and through our workshop, you will walk away with a practical understanding of these essential tools.</p> <p>There will be a lunch-break at about 2 pm, so don't feel that you are going for a 5-hour slug Money raised through this workshop will be used to help fund our CNC Milling Machine project.
