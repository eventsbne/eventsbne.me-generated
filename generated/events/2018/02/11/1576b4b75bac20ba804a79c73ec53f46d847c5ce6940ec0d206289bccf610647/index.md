    The Australian Skeptics (Gold Coast Branch) is an evidence-based
    organisation run by volunteer members.\r\n\u200bThe Skeptics encourage
    thoughtful, rational exploration of the world around us. The Skeptics are
    keen to promote scientific education and a sense of wonder in the natural
    world.\r\n\u200bThe Skeptics encourage people to think carefully and seek
    appropriate evidence before coming to a conclusion on any issue. From
    health, science, and technology to history, politics, and social sciences -
    critical thinking (or skepticism) can be universally applied.\r\n\u200bWe
    welcome people from all walks of life to join us and encourage a society
    that makes decisions based on evidence, reason and critical
    thinking.\r\nwww.gcskeptics.com
