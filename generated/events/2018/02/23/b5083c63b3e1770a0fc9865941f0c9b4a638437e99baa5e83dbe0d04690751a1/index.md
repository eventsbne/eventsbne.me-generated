<P>Stellar Tech Talks presents Future Tech</P>
<P>Everyday people across the globe are making technological breakthroughs and we aim to explore some of these within our meetups. For our first Tech Talk we are partnering with two of Brisbanes more innovative companies in the tech scene.  Tim Lucas CTO and Co-Founder of Immersive Robotics will guid us through Augmented and Virtual Reality and their VR Headset.  Tim will be joined by Rupender Grewal, Software Project Manager for Robosys, a startup that is currently looking at how the Pepper Robot can be introduced into various industries. </P>
<P>Tim and Rupender will not only discuss where the AR/VR and Robotics industry is now but what we can expect to see in the years to come and what you can do to prepare yourself if this is a field you would like to enter. </P>
<P>It should be an interesting night. Hope to see you all there.</P>
