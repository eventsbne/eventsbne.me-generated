<p>Hey y’all awesome people! Come join us for the first UI+VD Meetup of 2018! We have come up with an activity to get you thinking and explore UI elements. We will explore the use of components, colour theme, and typeface that will come together to create something awesome. Not a designer? Not a worry. It'll be a fun time for you to dabble in the minds of creating digital designs. If you’re a designer, great! We definitely need your chops and keen eye for design.</p> <p>Note: This may not be a usual Meetup. Our goal is to create an environment for people like you who are passionate for design to come along, have fun and take home something worth sharing.</p>
