<p>Ipswich City Council is the fastest growing region in Queensland.</p> <p>This growth can only be managed through involvement with community, industry, and other levels of government to protect and enhance our environment and its livability for current and future generations.</p> <p>There are many facets to developing a sustainable city. Many perspectives are required to understand the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities.</p> <p>On 8 February, Ipswich City Council and Fire Station 101 are bringing together people from diverse backgrounds in a unique sustainable future forum. The interactive workshop will allow people to hear about current Ipswich sustainability initiatives, collectively come up with ideas, and work together to develop solutions.</p> <p>Our discussion will be framed around key questions, including:<br/>• How can Ipswich be more sustainable?<br/>• How can Ipswich be carbon neutral?<br/>• How does Ipswich use waste as a resource?<br/>• What role does technology and being a smart city play in being sustainable?<br/>• How can Ipswich best educate and raise awareness around sustainability in our city?<br/>• How can Ipswich better plan and protect our natural environment?</p> <p>Join us to be a part of the conversation, with real opportunities to implement the ideas to create a more sustainable city.</p>
