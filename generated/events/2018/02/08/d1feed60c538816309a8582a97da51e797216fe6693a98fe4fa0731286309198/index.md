<p><b>Our Presenter:</b></p> <p>Enrique Bustamante - Meetup Host, Teacher, Data Scientist and massive nerd.</p> <p><b>Presentation Topic:</b></p> <p>Sometimes, the analytic approach to statistics is a bit of a pain. Symbol dense, needs looking up in a textbook or Wikipedia, and it's easy to forget the question you were asking initially. That's where hacking your way to an answer comes in.</p> <p>If you can write a for loop, you can get around to some pretty decent stats on your data, especially if you need something quick. In this presentation, attendees will learn about four computational statistical methods that are easy to remember and implement that can save quite a bit of time.</p> <p>
