<p>If you're like me, you have so many things to do to build your business, sometimes you don't know where to start or in which order to do them.</p> <p>We will spend this month and maybe more in the future looking at this graphic in detail. It will not only let you plan a social media campaign, but also allow you to help your customer form a business flow end to end.</p> <p>I suggest bringing your brain power and something to take notes on, I will make the infographic available to all via the meetup site. We will cover this colour by colour and at this stage I am not sure how fast we will travel through it.</p> <p>This will be interactive and so be prepared to ask questions is something is not clear to you.</p> <p>Parking is available underneath after 5pm. Meetings begin at 6pm so please consider this when coming down. The city flyer Bus stops right near here, so public transport is easy to access.</p>
