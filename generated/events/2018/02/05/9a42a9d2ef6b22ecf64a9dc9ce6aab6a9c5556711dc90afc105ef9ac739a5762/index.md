<p>👉🌏 How I learned to stop worrying and love charting North Korean missile ranges in D3.js - Josh Byrd</p> <p>Josh joined the ABC's Digital Storytelling Team a little over 6<br/>months ago as his first proper programming gig. Since then he's learned a<br/>bunch of stuff, and published one of last year's most impressive<br/>stories, drawing acclaim from Reddit and around the world. In this talk we'll be taken on Josh's learning journey and go through how to get off the ground with D3.</p> <p>👉✨ 6 ways to an Awesome API - Anna Gerber</p> <p>Anna has been working at Console Connect as the sole seniorNodeJS API developer for almost a year now, so she really knows her way around the ME[AR?]N stack. In this talk we'll discover the 6 simple ways to an Awesome API, and walk away with a clear idea as to how to approach our next API project.</p> <p>👉🌩 Your name here - Lightning talks!</p> <p>Are you working on something cool, or did you learn something new over the break? Share with the rest of us with a lightning talk on the night!</p> <p>It doesn't have to be polished or amazing, the point is to give it a go!</p> <p>👉 Code of Conduct</p> <p>BrisJS is dedicated to a harassment-free conference experience for everyone. Our anti-harassment policy can be found at: <a href="https://bris.js.org/#conduct" class="linkified">https://bris.js.org/#conduct</a></p> <p>👉 Food &amp; Drink</p> <p>Pizza &amp; drinks are provided by our sponsors at intermission.
