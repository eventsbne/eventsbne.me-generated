<H3>The way we power our cities, move people around, and produce goods and services is changing. Increasingly, we're electrifying our transport, reducing the resource intensity of industry, and producing energy from renewable sources.</H3>
<H3><STRONG>At the heart of this transition are cleantech <SPAN>entrepreneurs </SPAN>building profitable businesses that improve lives while reducing our environmental footprint. If you're interested in joining this growing group, then we hope you'll come along to EnergyLab's CleanTech Hackathon!</STRONG></H3>
<H3><BR></H3>
<P>This event is designed to bring people interested in cleantech startups together to brainstorm, develop and demonstrate new business concepts. Over the course of a weekend we'll help you find teammates (if you don't have a team already), come up with a cleantech startup idea, and refine it ready to present to a panel of judges. The winning team will receive a support package to help them make their ideas a reality.</P>

<H2>Frequently asks questions (FAQs)</H2>
<P><BR></P>
<P><STRONG>How many people are allowed in a team?</STRONG></P>
<P>Teams must contain 2, 3 or 4 people. Teams with 5 or more people in them must break into two or more smaller teams. Individuals can't compete but we will help you find at least one other person to form a team with (see below).</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><STRONG>I already have teammates, can I just participate with them?</STRONG></P>
<P>Yes! As long as you have at least one other person on your team (and your team doesn't have more than four people in it).</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><STRONG>I don't know anyone else attending, how will I form a team? </STRONG></P>
<P>We have your back! We have built in lots of ways for you to meet other people in the same boat and will help you form a team with people you want to spend the weekend with. Before the event you will be invited to a Facebook Group so you can start to get to know other people attending. The start of the event will includes a few different networking opportunities, both casual and structured. During the lunch, we'll help match individuals together and make sure no one is left out. If you have any questions or concerns please send an email to james@energylab.org.au.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><STRONG>Can I still participate if I don't have an idea?</STRONG></P>
<P>You can! We'll help your team find something interesting to work on over the weekend. </P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><STRONG>Do I have to spend the entire time at The Precinct?</STRONG></P>
<P>Nope, but we would encourage you to. It's a great venue and we'll provide a constant stream of food and drink. However, if you would be more comfortable elsewhere or have other commitments then you're free to come and go. Please just be back in time for the presentations on Sunday.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><STRONG>I have another question, who can I talk to? </STRONG></P>
<P>Send James Tilbury an email at james@energylab.org.au.</P>
