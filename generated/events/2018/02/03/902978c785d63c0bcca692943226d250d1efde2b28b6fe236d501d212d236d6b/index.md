<H3>Are you interested in the potential of business and technology to address challenges such as decarbonising our electricity grid and making transport more sustainable? Then we hope you will join us and other like-minded people for the Brisbane CleanTech Hackathon. </H3>
<P>EnergyLab and the Brisbane CleanTech Network have teamed up to organise this two-day event to bring together a diverse group of people to come up with and develop cleantech startup and social enterprise ideas. This will be a great opportunity to meet new people, work on an interesting idea, learn something new, and have some fun. The winning team will receive prizes and support to help them make their idea a reality. </P>
<P>Everyone is welcome to participate, so whether you're a cleantech expert or new to the area, can code or not, are a hackathon junkie or a first-timer, we hope we'll see you there.</P>

<H2>Frequently asks questions (FAQs)</H2>
<P><BR></P>
<P><STRONG>How many people are allowed in a team?</STRONG></P>
<P>Teams must contain 2, 3 or 4 people. Teams with 5 or more people in them must break into two or more smaller teams. Individuals can't compete but we will help you find at least one other person to form a team with (see below).</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><STRONG>I already have teammates; can I just participate with them?</STRONG></P>
<P>Yes! As long as you have at least one other person on your team (and your team doesn't have more than four people in it).</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><STRONG>I don't know anyone else attending, how will I form a team? </STRONG></P>
<P>We have your back! We have built in lots of ways for you to meet other people in the same boat and will help you form a team with people you want to spend the weekend with. Before the event you will be invited to a Facebook Group so you can start to get to know other people attending. The start of the event will include a few different networking opportunities, both casual and structured. During the lunch, we'll help match individuals together and make sure no one is left out. If you have any questions or concerns please send an email to james@energylab.org.au.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><STRONG>Can I still participate if I don't have an idea?</STRONG></P>
<P>You can! We'll help your team find something interesting to work on over the weekend. </P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><STRONG>Do I have to spend the entire time at The Precinct?</STRONG></P>
<P>Nope, but we would encourage you to. It's a great venue and we'll provide a constant stream of food and drink. However, if you would be more comfortable elsewhere or have other commitments then you're free to come and go. Please just be back in time for the presentations on Sunday.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><STRONG>I have another question, who can I talk to? </STRONG></P>
<P>Send James Tilbury an email at james@energylab.org.au.</P>
