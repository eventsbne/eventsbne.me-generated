title: Spotlighting Night Walk at Boondall Western Extension Bushland
date: '2018-01-28T11:34:06.093Z'

---
<P>Turn the spotlight on our nocturnal native wildlife and learn how they survive in the urban environment.  This night walk is part of the Kedron Brook Catchment Branch "Northside Squirrel Glider Monitoring Project" where we are monitoring council owned bushland reserves for the presence or absence of the Squirrel Glider.</P>
<P>On this Ecologist-guided night walk you may turn the spotlight on Squirrel Gliders, Brush-tail Possums or insectivorous bats as they go about their nightly business around the Boondall Western Exention Bushland Reserve.</P>
<P>Hopefully we will spot Squirrel Gliders as they trapeze their way through the trees and also identify other animals behind the rustles in the trees!</P>
<P>We will meet at the carpark of the Boondall Train Station (Stanworth Road side) for a short presentation on gliders and nocturnal wildlife that we may come across on our spotlighting.  Please arrive at 6:45pm for a 7:00pm start.</P>
<P>Limited places available so please book your ticket/s.  This activity is suited for children ages 6 and up.  If your booking includes children, please email enquiries@kedronbrook.org.au with the number of children and their ages in your booking.</P>
<P>Please wear warm clothing, enclosed footwear and bring your own personal torch.  KBCB will bring the fauna spotlight.  This is an all ages, family friendly event, however children must be accompanied by an adult.</P>
<P>Contact KBCB on enquiries@kedronbrook.org.au for more information.</P>
<P>This event is proudly supported by the Brisbane City Council Lord Mayor's Environment Grant.</P>
