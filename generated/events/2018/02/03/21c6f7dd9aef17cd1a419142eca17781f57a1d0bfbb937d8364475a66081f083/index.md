<p>• What we'll do<br/>Game Development Brisbane is back with a bang for 2018 with transmedia expert, Christy Dena discussing how to expand your Indie Game Franchise.</p> <p>Please note we have moved to a new venue - we'll now be hosting our meetups at JMC Academy. After the talk, we'll cruise over to The Fox Hotel for drinks. All welcome!</p> <p>You've seen how Blizzard, Ubisoft and Bungie and many other franchises extend the game world to webisodes, comics, books, ARGs and more. You might be thinking about how you can extend your own game on a much smaller budget? How do you decide what extensions to create? In this talk, I'll detail what players find appealing about these extensions and how you can execute a narrative design across media. Christy Dena is a writer-designer-director of Apps, installations, live games, tabletop games, and events. She served as National Chair and Department Coordinator of Games, SAE Creative Media Institute, and now is Senior Lecturer of Games. She was granted Australia's first Digital Writing Residency at The Cube, QUT; and commissioned to create an installation for Experimenta's 5th International Biennial of Media Art: Recharge. She has won numerous digital writing awards for her original projects, and created global digital projects for Nokia and Cisco, as well as consulted on VRTOV's VR project for SBS: The Thin Black Line. She is the organiser of the narrative design conference Crafting Intangibles, runs the Extended Experiences Lab, and co-runs an international residential lab for storytellers working in the fringes called Forward Slash Story.</p> <p>• What to bring</p> <p>Please note that due to JMC Academy’s OH&amp;S policy all attendees are required to wear enclosed footwear while on campus.</p> <p>• Important to know</p>
