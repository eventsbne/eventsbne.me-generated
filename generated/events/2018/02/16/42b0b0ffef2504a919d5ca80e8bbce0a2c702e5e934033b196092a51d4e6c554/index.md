<p>Come and join a special Chinese New Year themed Community Friday Drinks &amp; Pitches at Fishburners. Each week we get our community together to wind down the week, share wins and losses and have three of our startups introduce themselves to the community via a 3-5 minute pitch. These pitches are an informal way for our members to practice pitching and wind down the end of the week together. We've opened these events up to the public so if you want to stop by and see what goes on please join us. After the pitches, we're hosting a VR Games Night with Equal Reality. The Virtual Reality games night is a fun, open, family-friendly introduction to Virtual Reality where Equal Reality will be providing access to the latest VR hardware, games, and experiences. From shooting zombies with friends to painting amazing artworks to Minecraft. If you haven't tried VR this is will be a fun night for everyone!
