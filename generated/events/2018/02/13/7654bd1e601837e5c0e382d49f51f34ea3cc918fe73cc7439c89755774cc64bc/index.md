<p>How to create Human-centric products and services</p> <p>Join us at Fire Station 101 to learn about creating products and services that your customers will love. This session will focus on adopting basic human instinctive approach to product/service design. It will also include two case studies about an automated short distance instant delivery service start-up that made exponential growth just by incorporating the easiest way to order anything using free-form SMS, and another example about Flash Pack, a power bank that charges up 16 times faster than conventional power banks.</p> <p>Who should attend:<br/>Start-up founders with a product or service, who want to improve it using the human-centric approach, or if you have an idea about a product and service that you are thinking about exploring.</p> <p>About our Presenter:<br/>Abdullah Soomro is founder and CEO at Micropower Labs, he is the inventor of Flash Pack, a power bank that charges in just 15 minutes, and also the inventor of a personalized wearable cooling device, Cooly. Abdullah also runs a CryptoMining start-up in Pakistan.</p> <p>Abdullah is a guest in Australia based at Fire Station 101 as part of the Advance Queensland HotDesQ program. He has raised two equity-free rounds for his start-up Micropower Labs, one from Start-up Chile and another from HotDesQ. He was also the Alumni judge for last 3 Start-up Chile Applications.</p>
