If you're facing a problem, chances are that someone in the community has already faced and solved that same issue.<br/>Sharing your knowledge - pay it forward by using your experience to help others.<br/>Access to Sitecore specialists - hear about Sitecore capabilities straight from the source.</p> <p>Presenting this meeting on Feb 13 are:<br/>Andrew McLachlan, 4impact : Practical lessons learned using the Sitecore Helix architecture<br/>Anthony Hook, Sitecore: 5 ways to start using Sitecore 9â€™s Marketing Automation &amp; Email tool</p> <p>All refreshments will be provided - please register to attend to assist in catering.</p> <p>We want this to be a relaxed way to meet up with others interested in Sitecore.</p> <p><br/>General Agenda<br/>5:00 pm - drinks, introductions<br/>5:30 pm - short customer or partner presentation<br/>5:50 pm - short presentation from Sitecore<br/>6:10 pm - discussion with pizza in hand<br/>6:30 pm - close (with a plan to wind up by 7:00)</p> <p>The first meetup will be hosted by 4impact and occur on Feb 13.
