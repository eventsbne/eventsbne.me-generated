<p>• What we'll do<br/>This month, Brisbane Women in Blockchain Meetup will be talking with Sonja Bernhardt OAM, CEO of ThoughtWare. I am honoured that Sonja has agreed to be my guest as when she is not teaching about emerging technology on cruises, she is busy with her weekly show on local ABC Radio talking about women in technology and emerging technology. Sonja is my first guest who has their own Wikipedia Page and this is why:</p> <p>First Australian inducted into the WITI (Women in Technology International) Hall of Fame (2005)<br/>Optus ICT Achievement Award (2009)<br/>Queensland Government "Our Women, Our State" Awards - Industry or Business Category (2009)<br/>Listings in multiple Australian Who’s Who publications<br/>Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for services to the IT industry (2011)</p> <p>Please read more about Sonja here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonja_Bernhardt" class="linkified">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonja_Bernhardt</a></p> <p>Sonja is now immersed in the Aged Care Sector and how emerging technologies like blockchain can redesign the sector for a better future. We are certainly in the presence of a global leader and change maker in technology.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Complimentary lunch will be provided. Please DM me if you have any dietary requirements.</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>Brisbane Women in Blockchain Meetup has a code of conduct. I generally put aside 30 mins from 12.00 pm to 12.30 pm for a networking lunch then from 12.30 pm to 1.30 pm for the Meetup then 1.30 pm to 2.00 pm for more networking.</p>
