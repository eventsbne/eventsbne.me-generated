title: Everyday Scala & Show me the Monoids
date: '2018-02-09T11:24:17.001Z'

---
<p>Your Everyday Scala - Jacob Wang<br/>-----------------------------------------------<br/>This talk will introduce you to Scala, a hybrid OO/FP language running on the JVM. We will cover its language features, library/tooling ecosystem as well as our own experience running Skedulo's backend almost entirely in Scala.</p> <p>Show me the Monoids - Nat Dash<br/>----------------------------------------------<br/>In this talk we will discuss monoids and how they are defined. We will look at some examples of how this abstraction can make code cleaner.</p> <p>Finally, we will take a look at how monoids are used in a general purpose data structure - finger trees.</p>
