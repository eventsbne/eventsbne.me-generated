<P>Come together to help us build a shared Minecraft world in this Minecraft engineering session. You'll need to work as a team and co-operate with other participants to build a great city. We'll setup a shared server that all members can use and build on. We will have our server setup with land claims, this allows you to mark out a space that only you can build on (unless you grant rights to others).</P>
<P>Our Minecraft world will have lots of great buildings and cool things to explore.</P>
<P>We have 10 PC's with Minecraft accounts, but we have space / power / networking for you to bring your own PC and Minecraft account.</P>
<P>We will also have time for a building show and tell, you can show off your world to others in the group.</P>
<P>We are looking to make this a learning environment, if you already know all the secrets of Minecraft, you'll make a great leader, however if your new to Minecraft come along and learn about all the great things that can be built with this platform.Â </P>
