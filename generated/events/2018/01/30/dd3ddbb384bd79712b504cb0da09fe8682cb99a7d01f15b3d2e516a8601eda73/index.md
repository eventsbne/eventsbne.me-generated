<p>About our Meetup group:</p> <p>Welcome to the Elabor8 Lunch and Learn Meetup group! We're really excited to be kicking off for 2018. We'll be meeting monthly on the last Tuesday of each month over lunch time.</p> <p>About the talk:</p> <p>What tools, techniques and infrastructure allows starting a new project to accelerate, rather than get bogged down?</p> <p>We will be talking about what software development technology can do for you and what â€œgood" looks like, not a detailed how-to. After this talk you should have an idea of what a good starting toolset looks like, how good technology can help you maintain quality and gain confidence in your product, and what to expect from these tools whether you use the free SaaS versions or use vendor products run in-house.</p> <p>About the speaker:</p> <p>Robert has 20 years experience in the software development space where he has been an agile coach, software engineer and systems administrator, and also has a strong background in networks, network applications, the Internet, application &amp; network security; with a proven record of providing technical leadership, mentoring, training and coaching in both technical and agile team practices.</p> <p>This technical strength is complemented by a long interest in how teams collaborate to deliver successful products. These practices include Extreme Programming (XP), Scrum, Agile, DevOps and Continuous Delivery and have seen him convene the Agile and Lean Guilds at Suncorp to collaborate and share knowledge across the organisation.</p> <p>About Elabor8:</p> <p>A leading provider of Innovation and Agility expertise, Elabor8 teaches companies how to be forward thinking and adaptive, by looking at what the most innovative startup companies are doing and helping to adapt these methods for the enterprise.</p> <p>Lunch provided:</p> <p>We will be providing sandwiches and wraps to enjoy while listening to the talk.</p>
