You will, of course, be able to ask any questions you might have and we will be happy to answer them. We want to make sure this is an active community where you don't just come to listen but participate and learn by doing and discussing.</p> <p>We will let you know one week in advance about the structure of the event and the ICOs we will discuss.</p> <p>We look forward to seeing you there - there is a lot to learn!</p> <p>The Blockchain Reserve Team.</p>
