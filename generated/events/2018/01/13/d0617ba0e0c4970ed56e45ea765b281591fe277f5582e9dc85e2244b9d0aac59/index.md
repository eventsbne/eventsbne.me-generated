<P>Hi Brisbane Mappers! We have another mapping event coming up in January, and this time we will be helping <A HREF="https://www.mapillary.com/" TARGET="_blank" REL="noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow">Mapillary</A> and <A HREF="https://www.openstreetcam.org/" TARGET="_blank" REL="noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow">OpenStreetCam</A> collect photos for <A HREF="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" TARGET="_blank" REL="noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow">OpenStreetMap</A> for the <A HREF="https://blog.mapillary.com/update/2017/12/05/global-completethemap-challenge.html" TARGET="_blank" REL="noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow">#CompleteTheMap</A> challenge. <BR></P>
<H2>The Plan:</H2>
<P><STRONG>Saturday 13th January 2018</STRONG><BR><STRONG></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>15:00 - 16:00</STRONG>: Meet up over coffee at <A HREF="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/5177523039" TARGET="_blank" REL="noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow">The Gardens Club</A>, demonstration of Photo Mapping</P>
<P><STRONG>16:00 - 18:00</STRONG>: Split up and photo-map the <A HREF="http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/4282955" TARGET="_blank" REL="noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow">Brisbane Botanic Gardens</A><BR></P>
<P><STRONG>18:00</STRONG>: Drinks and socialise after at <A HREF="http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/49748203" TARGET="_blank" REL="noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow">The Buffalo Bar</A><BR><BR>Please feel free to call David on 0407 151 912 on the day if you can't find us.</P>
<H2>About OpenStreetMap</H2>
<P>OpenStreetMap is a collaboratively built free map of the world, with simple wiki-like editing; think ‘Wikipedia’, but for maps. The result is highly detailed digital maps, created and edited by local communities, that are free to reproduce without the normal commercial restrictions. It's a fun project to get involved with; you'll discover how maps are made and uncover the geographical secrets of your neighbourhood.<BR><BR>Volunteers from all around Brisbane have already begun mapping the roads, footpaths and cycleways across the city, but now we need your help to improve our map by adding street and building details and amenities such as restaurants, parks, playgrounds and shops.</P>
<H2>About Photo Mapping</H2>
<P>Mapillary and OpenStreetCam are services (and mobile apps!) that allow for StreetView-style imagery to be collected while walking, biking or driving (or boating, or hiking, or skiing, etc.) around an area. After the photos have been collected and uploaded, each photo can be viewed for creating OpenStreetMap data without having to leave the house (again!).</P>
<H2>The Event</H2>
<P>Participants will be welcome to map however and wherever they want, but we will focus on the day to use Mapillary or OpenStreetCam on your Android or Apple phone to collect photos of the Gardens and the surrounding city for use to improve OpenStreetMaps in this area.</P>
<P>It will help if you can install either app on your phone before-hand, but we will be happy to help on the day if you need assistance getting started.</P>
