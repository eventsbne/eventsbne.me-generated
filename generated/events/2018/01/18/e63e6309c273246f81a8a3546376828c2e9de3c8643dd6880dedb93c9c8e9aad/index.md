<p>• What we'll do<br/>It's that time again. Join us, the the BrisJS gang for drinks and networking at this month's networking drinks! This month we'll be heading to the iconic Brisbane Buffalo Bar.</p> <p>This is a drinks event, but there are also a number of non-alcoholic options at the bar. Finger food will be provided, but if you want something more substantial you can order from the bar.</p> <p>There is no set agenda for the night, just show up at 5:30 PM, chat with similar folks in tech. If you'd like an introduction, come and find me (Ash) and I'll make it happen!</p> <p>• What to bring</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>We're committed to making BrisJS a safe and enjoyable event. In short: please, behave like a decent human being. For more info, see our code of conduct. <a href="https://brisjs.org/#conduct" class="linkified">https://brisjs.org/#conduct</a></p>
