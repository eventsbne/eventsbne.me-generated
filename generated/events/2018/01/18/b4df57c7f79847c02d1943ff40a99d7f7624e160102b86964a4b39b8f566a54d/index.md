<p>Aside from being billion dollar companies, what do the following organisations all have in common?<br/>- Uber<br/>- Airbnb<br/>- Amazon<br/>- Apple<br/>- PayPal</p> <p>These companies were built on platforms: two-sided markets that are revolutionizing the way we do business. As digital networks increase in ubiquity, businesses that do a better job of harnessing the power of the platform will win. An indispensable guide, Platform Revolution charts out the brilliant future of platforms and reveals how they will irrevocably alter the lives and careers of millions. This presentation will cover the highlights of the book, "Platform Revolution", from a SAAS or Startup perspective.</p> <p>Important to know<br/>If you have not visited the new RCL location, please give yourself 30 mins extra time!</p>
