    About the event\nThe National Youth Science Forum\u2019s\u00a0Rotary \u0026
    Alumni Evening\u00a0is an opportunity for NYSF students to meet and network
    with alumni and rotary members from around the country.\u00a0\nThe evening
    will feature a keynote speech and Q\u0026A with Dr Rebecca Carey, in
    addition to short talks from recent NYSF alumni on their careers to date,
    and Rotaract about opportunities for young people in their home towns.\nThe
    event will conclude with refreshments and time to mingle and network.\nThis
    event is open to the public and free of charge.\nAbout the speaker\nDr
    Rebecca Carey is a Senior Lecturer and Australian Research Council DECRA
    fellow in the School of Physical Sciences in the Faculty of Science at the
    University of Tasmania. \nShe is a volcanologist with research themes in
    Earth and Marine sciences. Rebecca's research uses field studies,
    microanalytical and volatile analysis on the products of volcanic eruptions
    to understand magma's ascent to, and eruption at, the surface. Her expertise
    in volcanology of the modern seafloor and terrestrial settings has proven
    invaluable for knowledge and understanding of ancient volcano-sedimentary
    successions.\nDr Carey attended the National Youth Science Forum in 1997.

title: STEM "Speed Dating" - National Youth Science Forum Session B
date: '1516106511226.0'

---
<P>Are you involved in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) field? Did you study a STEM degree and are using those skills in the workplace? Are you working in a different area, or applying your studies in an unusual or non-traditional way? Whether you work in research, a science related field, or are using your skills in a completely different area - we want you to talk to students about your career pathway and how you got where you are.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P>Each January, The National Youth Science Forum (NYSF) brings 600 Year 12 students together for three 12-day immersive science experiences<SPAN>. One Session is held in Brisbane<SPAN>, and two in Canberra - each hosting 200 students</SPAN>. </SPAN>Students visit research labs and industry sites, hear from inspiring scientists, and participate in skill development workshops. </P>
<P><BR></P>
<P>A key part of the Year 12 Program is exposing students to the range of career paths available to those interested in STEM. <STRONG>We also provide opportunities for students to connect with "real life" professionals and researchers in an informal "speed dating" format.</STRONG></P>
<P><BR></P>

<P>In an informal setting, you’ll talk to a small group of students about your career path. The students might ask you about your study, fields of research, and current role, how you got to where you are today, and where you might be heading. The focus will be on informal discussions where students feel comfortable asking questions. Students will rotate, so you'll have 7-8 conversations lasting 5-7 minutes (the exact split will depend on the number of participants). There will be several breaks across the session where you can catch your breath, have some morning tea - and possibly continue conversations with any particularly interested students.</P>

<P><SPAN>The Queensland session will be held at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, and</SPAN> Canberra sessions will be held at The Australian National University.  You’re welcome to come to multiple STEM Speed Dating events, and to invite your colleagues to join in. Please book a 'ticket' to this event, so we know how many people are attending and that we can ensure the appropriate amount of chairs and refreshments for each attendee.</P>

<P><SPAN><SPAN>For Session A (Canberra) Speed Dating on 11 January, please go to </SPAN><A HREF="https://stemspeeddatingsessiona2018.eventbrite.com.au" TARGET="_blank" REL="noopener noreferrer noopener noreferrer">https://stemspeeddatingsessiona2018.eventbrite.com.au</A><SPAN>.</SPAN> </SPAN></P>

<P>Feel free to book tickets to multiple Speed Dating sessions. </P>
<P><BR></P>
<H2><STRONG>Questions</STRONG></H2>
<P><STRONG>Do I need to prepare anything beforehand?</STRONG></P>
<P>No, there's no need to write a speech or similar; this is an informal event with a Q&A format, where students will be encouraged to ask you about your work and career choices. If you'd like to jot down some ideas, here are some examples of possible questions the students might ask:</P>
<UL>
<LI>What did you do after Year 12? Why did you choose that degree/university/job?</LI>
<LI>If I wanted to do what you do, what should I do after Year 12?</LI>
<LI>What's the best part of your job? What's exciting about your research?</LI>
</UL>
<P>If you have any examples of your work or research please do bring them along - when we've run events like this in the past we've found that having something to "show and tell" can help break the ice and get students even more engaged.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><STRONG>Why are there three events? Do I have to attend more than one?<BR></STRONG></P>
<P>There are three sessions for the NYSF Year 12 Program, <SPAN>with 200 students attending each session</SPAN>:</P>
<P>Session A (Canberra): 2 - 13 January 2018</P>
<P><SPAN>Session B (Brisbane): <SPAN>9 - 20 January 2018</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN><SPAN>Session C (Canberra): <SPAN>16 - 27 January 2018</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P>All sessions have a STEM Speed Dating event and if you're able to, we would love to have you at multiple events, but that's not a requirement at all. We greatly appreciate the time people give up to support NYSF events every year. To register for session A, please go to <A HREF="https://stemspeeddatingsessiona2018.eventbrite.com.au" TARGET="_blank" REL="noopener noreferrer noopener noreferrer">https://stemspeeddatingsessiona2018.eventbrite.com.au</A>, to register for session C please go to <A HREF="https://stemspeeddatingsessionc2018.eventbrite.com.au" TARGET="_blank" REL="noopener noreferrer noopener noreferrer">https://stemspeeddatingsessionc2018.eventbrite.com.au</A>. </P>
<P><BR></P>
<P> <STRONG>Where should I park on campus?<BR></STRONG></P>
<P>A map of visitor parking is available to download at <A HREF="https://www.pf.uq.edu.au/maps/parking/01StLuciaCellOPark.pdf" TARGET="_blank" REL="noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pf.uq.edu.au/maps/parking/01StLuciaCellOPark.pdf</A> [PDF]. See <A HREF="https://www.pf.uq.edu.au/parking/casual.html" TARGET="_blank" REL="noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pf.uq.edu.au/parking/casual.html</A> for further information on visitor parking at ANU.</P>
<P>Unfortunately the NYSF is not able to reimburse participants for parking or transport costs.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><STRONG>Can I update my registration information?</STRONG></P>
<P>You can easily update the information you provide when you register through the Eventbrite system; see <A HREF="https://www.eventbrite.com.au/support/articles/en_US/How_To/how-to-update-your-ticket-registration-information?lg=en_AU" TARGET="_blank" REL="noopener noreferrer noopener noreferrer">https://www.eventbrite.com.au/support/articles/en_US/How_To/how-to-update-your-ticket-registration-information?lg=en_AU</A> for instructions.</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><STRONG>Can I invite my colleagues to participate as well?</STRONG></P>
<P>Yes! If you have colleagues or friends who you think would be great to speak to these students, please send them the link to the registration page. All that we ask is that all participants are currently working in the STEM field or studied STEM in the past, and are enthusiastic about sharing their experiences with young people.</P>
<P>We are particularly keen to get early career researchers and recent graduates involved in the sessions.</P>
<P>To help with organising we do ask that everyone who attends does register beforehand online; if people we're not expecting come along on the day we might not be able to fit them in</P>
<P><BR></P>
<P><STRONG>Any other questions?<BR></STRONG></P>
<P>Contact the National Youth Science Forum at programs@nysf.edu.au, or (02) 6125 2777.</P>
