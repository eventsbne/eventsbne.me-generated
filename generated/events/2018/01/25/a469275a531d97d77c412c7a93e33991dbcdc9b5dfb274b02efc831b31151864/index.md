<p>â€¢ What we'll do<br/>We will be giving away a perpetual Substance Painter subscription at this meetup! See details below.</p> <p>Alex &amp; Sean will be revealing a VR game they've been working on and you will have an opportunity to be the first batch of testers! See how it was built!</p> <p>We will be continuing on as we stitch together the fundamentals of a mobile game using Unreal Engine. Our project is named Descension, designed for apple and android devices and by the community (that is, anybody interested!). We have a great opportunity to learn from each other as we build and deploy a game we can call our own, and any person of any experience level is welcome to participate.</p> <p>If mobile game development isn't your thing, we comprise of many and various interests ranging from VR to serious games and visualisations. We would love to get to know you over a beer and some pizza, so good times ahead no matter what. We promise? :-D</p> <p>Substance! Yes, this little gem by allegorithmic is really exciting and we're offering a perpetual subscription, which is much like a lifetime's supply of chocolate for an unreal dev. To be in the draw which will be called at our meetup, you simply need to model something for our mobile game project Descension. You can model absolutely anything which you think might be useful for the game, whether that be an alien drone or some kind of outer-space life support device--you decide! (you may need to refresh your mind on the game's storyline). Reach out to us if you need any help or direction and we'll be glad to help. You can also find us on our Discord server "Brisbane Unreal Engine" and on FB. Hope you do well with it and we can't wait to see what fun models appear for the game.</p> <p>Look forward to seeing you on Thursday the 25th of January in Brisbane @ The Edge!</p> <p>Your Brisbane Unreal Engine Team</p>
