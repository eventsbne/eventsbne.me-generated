<p>• What we'll do<br/>Join the official Crypto Strategies meetup for future events: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/CryptoStrategies/" class="linkified">https://www.meetup.com/CryptoStrategies/</a></p> <p>"Due to high demand I've created this free meetup, which will continue regularly for the foreseeable future. This session accommodates for those with no prior knowledge relating to Cryptocurrency trading and will include Q&amp;A along the way.</p> <p>First I'll go over the basics by explaining things like: how to view and interpret the price charts, trading methods, risks involved, where to trade, etc.</p> <p>I will then do a live price analysis on Bitcoin and other popular Cryptocurrencies. Depending on how we go for time, I may analyse additional coins requested by the audience."</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Material to take notes, if you wish to do so.</p> <p>• Important to know</p>
