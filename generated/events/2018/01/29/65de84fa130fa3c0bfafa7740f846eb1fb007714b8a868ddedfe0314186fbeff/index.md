<p>AI is already part of the standard toolset of many trailblazing technology companies. Running an Inception for an AI project is a bit different, and the difference brings some new challenges in the quality space.</p> <p>In this presentation, Hari will talk about how to build quality successfully in projects with an AI twist.</p> <p>Arrive anytime after 5.30pm for a 6pm start. Pizzas will be available on the night and are provided by ThoughtWorks.</p> <p>In case you arrive after 6pm and are not able to go up the elevator, please call ThoughtWorks on 3129 4506.</p>
