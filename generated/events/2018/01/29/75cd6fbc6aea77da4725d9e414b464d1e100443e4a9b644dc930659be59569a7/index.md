<p>• What we'll do<br/>Social meet and greet to kick off 2018 for Brisbane EmberJS. We'll have interesting and brief talks from some EmberJS practitioners, eat some gourmet pizza, drink some beverages and get to know the community. Get in touch if you'd like to present a topic!</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Just yourself. We'll have a giveaway of our cryptotokens (if we can get them working!) so install an ERC20 compatible Ethereum wallet on your phone.</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>We'll be in the GBST office so please stay in the meeting space and don't wander around the desks. You're welcome to bring a friend, but please ask them to RSVP on Meetup.com in advance so we have enough food.</p>
