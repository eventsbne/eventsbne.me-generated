<p>• What we'll do<br/>New year, new talks! Come and listen to some quality speakers, network with other frontend devs, and chat about all the cool things going on in the React ecosystem.</p> <p>As always, the meetup is great for both newbies &amp; veterans alike. There's free beers &amp; pizza provided. Talks start at 6:30. Feel free to arrive any time after 6:00.</p> <p>-- AGENDA</p> <p>* Talk 1 - Pattern Face-Off: Higher Order Components vs. Render Props (30 mins)<br/>Higher Order Components have long been a popular pattern for composition in React, but the "render prop" pattern has gained a ton of traction of late. Which is better? Which is more composable? Julian from Rex takes us through the nitty gritty of both, going over the best practices for implementing these patterns and highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.</p> <p>* Talk 2 - What's New In the React Ecosystem (15 mins)<br/>Tom from Rex will take us through some of the latest news &amp; packages of interest that have cropped up over the past few months.</p> <p>-- SPONSORS</p> <p>Pizza sponsored by Just Digital People.</p> <p>Beers and venue sponsored by Rex Software.</p> <p>-- BECOME A SPEAKER</p> <p>Want to give a talk? Let us know via Meetup messenger or post a Github issue:<br/><a href="https://github.com/Brisbane-React-JS/meetups/issues" class="linkified">https://github.com/Brisbane-React-JS/meetups/issues</a></p> <p>All our speakers are now rewarded with a React T-shirt thanks to Glen from FunCaptcha :)</p> <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>Street parking can be pretty tricky, so it would be a good idea to allow extra time if driving. There is 2 hour free parking nearby at Gasworks.</p> <p>If you choose public transport, the venue is close to the Teneriffe Ferry Terminal and buses. Front door will be open for the event.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Nothing (though a laptop can be useful)</p>
