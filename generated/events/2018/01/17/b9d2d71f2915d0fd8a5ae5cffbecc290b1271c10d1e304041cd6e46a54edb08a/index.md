<p>• What we'll do<br/>Kicking off 2018, Brisbane Women in Blockchain will be talking with Emma Weston, Co-Founder and CEO of AgriDigital. In 2017, Emma was announced as the Female FinTech Leader of the Year, Emerging FinTech Leader of the Year, and AgriDigital secured Excellence in Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Award. In addition, Emma serves on the Australian Digital Commerce Association Board, regularly speaks at FinTech / Blockchain conferences and is a key voice leading the conversation in Australia on the digitalisation of the Australian dollar. AgriDigital is regularly reported in the media and has completed two successful pilots for grain payment using blockchain technology. Emma is one of the first women in Australia to co-found a blockchain company and the first as a Chief Executive Officer. This Meetup will be very special indeed!</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Complimentary lunch will be provided. Please DM me if you have any dietary requirements.</p> <p>• Important to know<br/>Brisbane Women in Blockchain has a code of conduct. I generally put aside 30 mins from 12.00 pm to 12.30 pm for a networking lunch then from 12.30 pm to 1.30 pm for the Meetup then 1.30 pm to 2.00 pm for more networking.</p>
