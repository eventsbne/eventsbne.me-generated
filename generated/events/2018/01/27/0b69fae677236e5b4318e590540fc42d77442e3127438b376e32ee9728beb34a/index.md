<p>• What we'll do<br/>This is the monthly meetup for users of Blender - a piece of open-source 3d software (blender.org (<a href="http://www.blender.org" class="linkified">http://www.blender.org</a>))</p> <p>Whether you're a veteran of the software or a complete newbie that's interested in getting started, you'll fit right in.</p> <p>At the meetup we share the projects we're working on, ask questions, get help or just watch to see what others are doing with the software.</p> <p>Participants are welcome to bring along their work (images, videos or blend files) on a USB or laptop and get feedback or help from others members.</p> <p>Snacks and cold drinks are provided! Please just bring a gold coin donation to cover expenses.</p> <p>Join our Facebook group: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/478898222462942/" class="linkified">https://www.facebook.com/groups/478898222462942/</a></p> <p>---------------------</p> <p>Parking</p> <p>You can park either on the street, or undercover at Kelvin Grove Village (map: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/1hL9kme3mCS2" class="linkified">https://goo.gl/maps/1hL9kme3mCS2</a> ) - the first two hours are FREE, and it's $10 every hour after. There are also a number of alternative parking garages, for around $5-10 for several hours.</p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Laptop (if you have work you want to share)</p> <p>• Important to know</p>
