<p>This is one of our regular fortnightly meetings. We meet to discuss and help with computer problems to do with Unix like operating systems (bsd, linux, darwin etc).</p> <p>We head off for dinner at the St Lucia Village around six thirty, the common destination is the Curry Connection.</p> <p>Occasionally we have talks, we generally start those around five.</p>
