<p>• What we'll do<br/>Come and join us for Fishburners weekly Friday drinks and community pitch night. Each week we get our community together to wind down the week, share wins and losses and have three of our startups introduce themselves to the community via a 3-5 minute pitch. These pitches are an informal way for our members to practice pitching and wind down the end of the week together. We've opened these events up to the public so if you want to stop by and see what goes on please join us. See you there!</p> <p>(If you're not a Fishburners member and would like the opportunity to pitch please email [masked] to apply for a spot)</p> <p>Please note: by RSVPing to this event you agree to joining Fishburners email newsletter.</p> <p>• What to bring</p> <p><br/>• Important to know<br/>Entry is via the Brisbane Information Centre/Regent Theatre.</p>
