<P>Use Roblox to design and build a 3D world that game be used to code up a game. Building Block Studio will show you how to use the Roblox Studio tool to bring 3D objects into the world. We will also show you the scripts that can be attached to 3D objects to really bring them to life.</P>
<P>Learn how to make things explode, use spawn points, use touch events to make things move!</P>
<P>We don't use any of the online chat features, this is all about building in a 3D world that is very closely aligned to professional programming tools such as Unity. This is a great introduction to scene building and coding in a 3D environment.</P>
