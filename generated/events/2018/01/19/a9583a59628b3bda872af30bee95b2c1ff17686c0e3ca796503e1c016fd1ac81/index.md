<p>Christmas was a busy time. There's plenty of competition for events during December. We've change up the January event to celebrate the new year (Chinese New Year is mid-Feb). We've changed the normal time and date for everyone to attend.</p> <p>We are also be making some other launch announcements with a new community called Hacking Health that (I'll be involved in). Hear about what's happening with this new community.</p>
