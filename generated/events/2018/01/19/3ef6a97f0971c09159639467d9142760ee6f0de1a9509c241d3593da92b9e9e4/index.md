<p>Let's keep that new year motivation rolling right into Miss Jones in Fortitude Valley/New Farm this Friday üë©üèª‚Äçüè´ü•ë</p> <p>Consider this a support group for digital product designers. Our aim is to tighten our design community in Brisbane to share and gain knowledge from outside of our regular circles.</p> <p>This is a pretty casual affair. You just need to turn up, order a delicious breakfast or a coffee, and talk product design with some rad new people.</p> <p>Bring along any problems you're currently working through, or any product design #hotdrama topics you'd like the group's take on?</p> <p>Better yet, if there's something you're hanging to discuss, post it in our new Slack (<a href="https://productof.slack.com" class="linkified">https://productof.slack.com</a>) to get some pre-breakfast conversation happening.</p> <p>Hope to see you there and we look forward to building a better and more connected design community in Brisbane.</p> <p>*You will need to pay for your own food and/or drinks.*</p> <p>Stay in touch: Join our Slack (<a href="https://productof.slack.com" class="linkified">https://productof.slack.com</a>) to keep the conversations going the rest of the week. Email [masked] or [masked] for an invite.</p>
