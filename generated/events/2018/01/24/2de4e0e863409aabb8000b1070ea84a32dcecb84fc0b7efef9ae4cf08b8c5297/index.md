<p>This is our main weekly meeting for TechSpace members and guests to work on their projects or come learn a new skill.</p> <p>This meeting is open to guests. To become a full TechSpace member please see our separate Membership page (<a href="https://gctechspace.org/members/" class="linkified">https://gctechspace.org/members/</a>) on the gctechspace.org website.</p> <p>It is not a talk fest: members are usually working on projects, either alone, working with someone else, or demoing something to the group. If there is a theme for the week, someone in the group might go off to the side and present something or lead a study group.</p> <p><img src="http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/a/7/e/600_310707262.jpeg" /></p> <p>This meeting is open to all, but if you have already been to TechSpace a few times though, it's good etiquette to apply to be a member. Please refer to "Membership" Web page (<a href="https://gctechspace.org/members/" class="linkified">https://gctechspace.org/members/</a>) for more details.</p>
