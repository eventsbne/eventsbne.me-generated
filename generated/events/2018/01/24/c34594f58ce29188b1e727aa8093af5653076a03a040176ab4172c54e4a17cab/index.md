<P>It's that time again. Come join the Brisbane LGBT &amp; Allies in Tech crew for drinks and chatting at the third of what's to become monthly pub meets!</P>
<P>Brisbane LGBT &amp; Allies in Tech put on monthly networking events for the community to come together and meet likeminded folks. This event is for everyone in the tech industry, those who want to be, or those with a passing interest. You might be in design, development, marketing, operations, management, support, or anything else! Feel free to register, and come meet some friendly folks.</P>
<P><STRONG>For something different, this time we'll be visiting trendy, West End gin bar Bosc. (Note, there's beer on tap and lots of choices other than gin).</STRONG></P>
<P><BR></P>
<H2>The Agenda</H2>
<P>There is no set agenda for the night, just show up at 6 PM, grab a drink, and chat with your peers in the industry. If you'd like an introduction, come and find me (Ash) and I'll introduce everyone!</P>
<P>This is a drinks event, but there are also a number of non-alcoholic options at the bar. Bosc doesn't do food, but they allow you to BYO. So if you find yourself peckish we can pop across the road to Zagyoza for hand made gyozas (or anything else in the area for that matter).</P>
